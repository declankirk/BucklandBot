you

you

hello see anyone there participants to

me Michelle hey Michelle

how are you Yohe very early all right

I'm gonna stop the recording now

just doing a test I'm gonna turn on Chet

all right it's recording now how's that

thank you okay

ah some people have turned their cameras

on thank you very much guys that's

absolutely fantastic you will go to the

top of the list so you're the people I

see first that is really good

oh it's so nice to see so many of you

some of you I haven't seen for ages this

summer hi Alyssa hi mark hi Evie he just

disappeared she was here briefly there

she is hey in that's fantastic Lillian

thanks everyone

Tom I can see you now um playing the

play school game so everyone welcome

we're doing communication why are we

doing communication it's a security

course it's not a communication course

um as I was saying just a second ago

years ago we didn't teach communication

in this course bonus mark for camera on

I reckon absolutely definitely should go

in your portfolio is community helping

the community well done um so why not

yeah what was a problem with not

teaching communication well all my early

graduates went out hunt but like around

the year 2000 and they went out into

industry and they had cyber roles and

they had to influence people in order to

get things done they had to show people

vulnerabilities and get people to fix

them had to persuade boards to give them

money they had to get promoted they had

to encourage people to put attention

into security when no one wanted to

without communication he is sort of

nothing what's the best example of that

oh yeah global warming scientists have

known about global warming for so long I

found some old notes from when I started

teaching back in the 90s how depressing

zat and I did a class on global warming

and talking about why aren't we doing

anything about it what's going on we all

brainstormed about that and tried to

work out ways that was in the 90s so

we're still really not doing anything

about it how can it be you know people

blame politicians I blame scientists how

can scientists be so incompetent as to

know about this danger before anyone and

not have actually brought about change

they just grumble and complain you know

thanks Lynn

to be able to work out how to affect

change politicians affect change

businesspeople affect change ugly nasty

corporations affect change why don't the

good guys affect change right why they

don't is because we're hopeless at

communication particularly scientists

and mathematicians and maybe even

security people too so let's learn how

to communicate not because we want to

hear the sound of our own voice but

because we want to have change once I've

impact in the world so um so now we

always have a unit on changing

communication and how to affect up and

down how to manage up and how to manage

down how to bring about change um now

last year when the guys that went to

Amazon we're doing the Amazon web

security project we're doing their final

presentation to all the bigwigs at

Amazon I was there too they all gave a

big presentation and at the end after

every one ago and I stayed back and gave

them presentation notes so to improve

their presentation and because they're

all senior students just about to

graduate in fact most of them have

graduated and gone on to amazing jobs I

was pretty ruthless and I just told them

actually what I thought because they're

everyone from Amazon was saying oh how

nice oh yeah you guys are really good

all that was really impressive and I

thought yeah that's because you're sort

of thinking students aren't pretty good

but if some of your employees gave a

talk like this you would just roast them

because it wasn't very good so the work

they'd done was good but the way they

communicated it and presented it and

argued for funding and bring about

change that wasn't good so I I said look

no no no no no I went through this long

list of things that they could have done

better and they could have done

differently in different ways they could

have thought about it and how they

should have approached it differently

and at the end I worried a bit that I've

been negative and I said guys I'm really

sorry this is a great day for you and

everything's good but I just know you're

better than this and you can do

fantastically well and they were

actually really enthusiastic a couple

have spoken to me since just out of the

blue just saying that was one of the

best bits that they got from me in that

course really nothing else was really

good because um because actually it

shocked them and made them change how

they communicate and one of them said

something this one telling you this

long-winded story he said you know as

you were giving us all this feedback I

remembered this is what we covered in

security engineering

you've told us his stuff already you

know I feel really stupid

because I knew it and I didn't use it

and he went away and he didn't know he

just said the most devastating thing in

the whole world to me because what he

was saying wasn't that he was stupid

what he was saying was that I Richard

had failed I had tried to communicate

something and change the people and I'd

said all the words and done all the

things and put it in the exam and all

that sort of stuff but they hadn't

changed at the end they were still

communicating in the same way now I

think after happened twice hopefully

they've changed but this is my way of

leading into the whole point of

communication so before we jump into the

details people always want to learn

little technical things about or where

do you stand and do you do PowerPoint

and all that sort of stuff all these

little tips but before we get to that

the sort of tactics we should talk about

the bigger picture the strategies or

even the goals so what are we trying to

do with communication let's get that

really clear as far as I'm concerned

there's only one point to communication

and this applies to all communication

communication is there so you can bring

about change if you're not bringing

about change then you're not

communicating and if you're

communicating but it doesn't have to

lead to anything changing then while

you're talking you're just an empty drum

of clashing cymbals for heaven's sake if

you're talking you're going to bring

about change there's no other reason so

before you start any piece of

communication regardless of who's asked

you to do it and what they've said and

all the blah blah blah words people have

said you yourself work out in your own

mind before you start why am I doing

this what change do I want to bring

about now you might think of seven or

eight or nine or a hundred things you

want to do that's fine but what I

encourage you to do is just pick one and

write that down and focus on that and

that is your main thing because you're

lucky to pull one off maybe you can get

two you'll never get a hundred so pick

the main one and anything else is icing

on the cake and have firmly fixed in

your mind what is the main change I want

to achieve with this communication event

I'm just about to do so that's step one

write that down

step two is that you then have to

understand the people you're talking to

I had a prop hang on

my shoes my boots it's gonna bring up

with a bit to my girls too but I just

brought mine oh um

you cannot bring about a change in

someone without understanding them just

forget it

they're not robots they're human beings

their elaborate complex machines on a

predetermined path already and you've

got a really small bandwidth sort of

hole into their head where you can get

in you can affect change to this tiny

little thing using their eyes and their

ears and their mouth and this the smell

and they touch using all their senses

which is that bigger pipe you have

access to their brain briefly while

you're talking to them and they're

giving you attention so how are we going

to bring about change will changes

inside them it's not in the world it's

not in you it's in them how do you bring

about changing them you need to

understand them you need to work out how

can I use a brief moment I've got with

them and those brief channels to bring

about the change in their mind so

communication this is point number two

communication is not about what you say

it's not about what you do communication

is all about the impact it has on your

listener or listeners and regard them as

a series of individual people they're

not a group so at the end of the often a

key lecturer saying I covered that in

the lecture or I felt I gave a good

lecture I felt I didn't give a good

lecture and it's all about them and what

they're saying and I know people that

think that teaching is about explaining

and what sometimes when I ask people to

apply for the job you know if you want

to be a tutor or a lecture or something

like that I say why do you think you'd

be a good tutor or lecture and often

they talk about how the good they are at

explaining things and I'm going mm-hmm

because you know that's an okay skill

you know it's better than not having

that skill I guess but that is not the

main skill and if you think that's the

main skill that's dangerous because

teaching or communication isn't about

explaining it's about which is something

you do it's about changing them it's

something that happens inside their head

it's really easy to forget that I've

just said it probably seems obvious but

I bet the next time you speak you forget

it it's so easy to forget that so

somehow burn it into your brain that all

you're trying to do when you're

communicate is change someone else so

communication is about a listener it's

not about the speaker

now why do I know that doesn't work

why do I know people forget that because

I look at so much communication that

goes on and it's a disaster a lot of

government communications I look at them

they're very expensive you can see

someone it's a good show that analyzes

communication what's the grand transfer

if you can never see the grown transfer

on ABC sometimes they look at government

political advertising and do a

reasonable analysis it's often written

to make the minister happy or the person

commissioning it happy or the

organization that does it happy I'd even

go so far as to say official emails from

sometimes UNSW or other units are fall

in this category too it's sort of

designed and the listener is the person

paying for it or funding it or sending

it out that's that's what the people

building it a thing about but actually

the listener has to be the person

receiving the message what's a good

example all right there's two ones once

a very funny video and I'll show it when

we get a break I've just remembered I'm

gonna write it down I won't tell you you

might have already thought about it's so

dreadful the other example is this when

I used to be we led walking around in my

teenage years trying to earn money I got

it by delivering leaflets which means

I'd have a have a sec on my back full of

pamphlets and I'd walk around the

suburbs pushing leaflets in people's

letter boxes Hey

um just looking at the messages of runts

writing that's very nice so a leaflet

deliver is an interesting job it's quite

hard is very heavy especially at the

start and then towards the end it's

quite light it's good for optimization I

yes I spend a lot of my time working at

graph traversal algorithms and ways of

going around that the thing so I just

did men um um walking and things like

that it was all very quite interesting

but here's the thing

you're often in a slightly stress State

are you doing it if it's heavy and

raining and you've got a deadline and

you sort of left it till the last day to

do it and sometimes you come across

letter boxes where people don't want

leaflets in their letterbox and one

advertising material so they put

communication on the box I put a little

sign on and I've seen so many different

signs because I read them all this I'm

telling the leaflets and I remember one

most of them look like this and it's one

in particular I'm thinking of

it said no junk mile exclamation mark

with a picture of a really angry face or

something like that not circle and a

line threatened just a lot of anger and

I don't know I'd be walking around and

I'm paid to put it in your letterbox

that's my job

I'll get in trouble if I don't put it in

the letterbox and I'm walking up to the

letterbox I've gone to a lot of trouble

to get to your letterbox and then

there's an angry signer that's shouting

at me telling me not to do something

with exclamation marks stuff you I would

just put it in the letterbox

um and I remembered it was this one

angry guy he's the one I'm thinking

about that used to come out and I think

yeah I don't become a liberal politician

hmm but this was when he was quite young

and he would come out and he would just

shout at me angrily and he would say get

rid of this and once he took it out and

he ripped it up and threw it on the

ground and said yeah whatever don't put

this in my letterbox

so I would wait till he wasn't around

I'd put it in and on the way back I'd

put another one in and sometimes I'd

make a special trip to stuff a couple

more in because I was a 15 year old boy

and he'd been shouting at me making me

feel terrible so I was angry with him so

you know I just hated him so I would

whenever possible put leaflets in his

litter box all right why am I telling

you this long and somewhat not very

positive reflection on me story for this

reason the people putting the letterbox

signs on the letter boxes weren't

thinking about communication and bring

about change

they were venting their anger when they

were buying those signs there must be

very angry that they got letters in the

leaflets in their letterbox

I don't know why but they must got very

angry about it no venting that anger in

the sign they chose to put on the litter

box it was entirely about them that

piece of communication and they weren't

thinking there's a testosterone-driven

15 year old boy who's tired and bit

weary and stressed who's pushing these

until all the letter boxes I won't think

about me

you know there were other people that

put different signs on can anyone

imagine just stop and think now what

sign would you put on your letterbox

so I don't put a leaflet in it just

think about it

maybe like a solution would be to sell

them

hi I'm not going to read your junk notes

please like let's be wary of the

environment and give to someone who's

interested yeah yeah so give me a reason

that's right Aaron that's a good one

I've gotta say Saint John makes me I

mean you're sort of attacking me so that

actually when anyone I don't know if

you've noticed I've noticed this a lot

with children if you're communicating to

someone then you say angry things or

criticize them there's something in

their brain that switches off when they

stop listening now it's not just their

brains my brain is pretty hard to notice

things about yourself but since not

having children I've noticed that I'm

the same if someone says anything

critical at all is very hard I have

emotional reactions very hard to listen

to what's going on but yeah that's

exactly right give me a reason that's a

good one police property no junk mail

threaten me I'm a 16 year old boy I

don't care yeah I try and make sort of

light of this situation something like

my neighbor likes mail more than I do

or my neighbor really likes discounts

something like that please yeah don't

don't get one camera give him experts

thank you yeah I reckon you're now

starting tipping the way you need to

think to solve the problem you're trying

to get inside the mind of the deliverer

maybe what you should do before you even

put the signs out is just watch a couple

of days and see who did a live resume

maybe sometimes a 15 year old boys maybe

the girls maybe they're all people who

knows and then whatever you do target it

to them anymore because they're great

ideas anyone else with the thought don't

you get paid like per leaflet your

handout or per a certain amount of

leaflets though so by not by not putting

a leaflet in something you've already

walked up to you're actually losing

income that's exactly right though so

like is there anything that you can say

that will stop someone doing that maybe

you can give them like a dollar is a

really good thinking I mean you're

exactly right

I'm paid for the number of leaflets I

put in they spot-check households to

make sure that I have delivered them and

I get in trouble if there is one so

don't get him

or if someone rings up and complains

like what if there was an angry letter

on the letterbox but the guy that wrote

it wasn't there and he

a visitor coming that day and I really

wanted that came out catalog and they

didn't get it and they rang up and

complained to Kmart or came up would

bring up my distributor and the

distributor would call me and they would

well it wouldn't be good so yeah you're

absolutely right my thinking my interest

is not in my interest to not put it in

and you're thinking oh how can you solve

that interest now got to say I only get

a cent or two it's more the fear of

getting seniors incompetent or dishonest

by the pamphlet company but yeah that's

right

there was some people that put signs up

and I didn't put it in any one case it

was very simple but it's still sort of

attacking me it's tacking me enough

anyway but it's still sort of you know

what I'm doing guys in the bean well I

mean it couldn't all these things could

work but I'll tell you what work for me

is if someone said the word please if it

wasn't all in caps it was in graying

rather than red or black a winky face is

good and said I'll please don't give us

any leaflets we don't need them Oh

unknown leaflets please we're trying to

save trees smiley face have a nice day

something like that I'd go war you're my

best friend I'm not giving you any

leaflets these bastards put leaflets in

there already and reach in and take them

out and some bills I've take them out

poignant put them so you would win me

over and get me onside if you thought of

me as a person that's exactly right so

good thinking everyone and that is the

nature of this problem I want every ear

here take my it is p11 it's a P limit oh

[Laughter]

yeah it certainly is the case delivering

leaflets you get intimate with letter

boxes and you notice how visible and

easy did it is to put things in and take

things out of litter boxes okay so so

the idea of communication of hope you've

got it now is you need to get in the

mind of the other person that you don't

do alright here's what I've got now I'm

gonna race through my point super quick

hypnotizing chickens is the first one so

the I don't know if you've ever heard of

this phrase but the US Army use it it's

what they call PowerPoint presentations

so if I have to give some information

the media that they don't really want to

give them like oh we accidentally killed

some civilians or something when we did

a bombing raid today and what they do is

they give a very long presentation with

lots of incomprehensible PowerPoint

slides and charts and they're packed

full of stuff and maybe it's 40 slides

long and around about slide 37 they slip

in and we killed some civilians today

and then there's 38 and 39 which don't

talk about it and so they have disclosed

it but everyone's better and no one

actually listens to that part and I

actually call it hypnotizing chickens

this process of putting up a whole lot

of boring stuff on PowerPoint first so

people stop listening so you can slip

the other thing in so PowerPoint is a

great example of bad communication it's

designed so you feel good about what

you've said and it's all about the point

you're going to cover I think the people

who use it are never thinking of the

mind of the people looking at it it's

very hard to be interested when you're

looking at a PowerPoint I don't want to

pay other people Tim yeah I'm being

distracted in my own lecture and then

the lecture has started chatting with

people and he wasn't paying attention

either so yeah so hypnotising chicken so

PowerPoint be very very careful shoes

yep you got to walk in the miles of the

other person in the shoes of the other

person walk a mile in their shoes to

understand them as the old phrase goes

that's really what you got to do

objective yes you've got to work out

what your objectives are so I gave a

talk on recently little training

exercise for some students in the career

a career skill thing in the holidays

when we were I was training them and how

to communicate and I gave them little

scenario so you've now got to make this

announcement to this person know you're

in this company you got to do this or

you're in this embarrassing situation

you have to do this so you have to one

was you have to give a funeral speech

and one of them was you had to give an

apology for something you're in the

government or so no they're all just a

difficult situation so give every team a

different scenario and then they gave an

actual presentation at the end and then

we assess them all about how well

they've gone and there was this stark

difference between the people that

straightaway like my former students

forgot the whole stuff I said at the

beginning and just jumped in and tried

to make an interesting and entertaining

talk and those that remembered the

beginning bit so I've only we've done a

little bit from the beginning but can

you remember it the most important thing

to focus on changing the opinion of the

listener yes that's exactly it thanks

Han um

it's work out what change you want to

bring about work out the objective of

the talk and I suggest one change and

then everything relates to that so if

you think shall I kill three of us talk

or two of us talk should we all talk

we'll take turns in talking it's not an

issue of fairness it's not an issue of

marking it's not an issue of anything

it's entirely an issue of what will help

us achieve our objective best if we want

to do this difficult conversation and

persuade people then maybe it's better

if there's one person who's a

representative assault maybe multiple

voices show that we've got consensus or

whatever yes someone have to give a talk

to the vice chancellor to persuade him

to try and persuade him to change

trimesters um you know there was just

all these different talks that people

had to do and the people that did that

talk actually structured it really well

in terms of having lots of people

talking and just giving the sense that

they're all really reasonable and people

that the Vice Chancellor would like and

that there was a critical mass of them

that wanted some sort of a change in

some way not to get rid of trimesters

because they'd never achieved that

objective they instead have the

objective of making them better in some

way um so so wasn't it

also so it's like closing the deal for a

Salesman it's exactly like closing the

deal for a Salesman that's right a

Salesman knows what they want which is

the sale that's exactly have you done

salesmanship no but I had like heard

this audio book about the salesmen like

how do close a deal I think the deal is

when the person actually signs when you

actually get the money and that's your

objectives there's no point making them

happy showing the car making them like

the car

making them think they'll probably buy

the car promising they'll call you to

buy the car and then they go and buy it

somewhere else cheaper online you

actually need to close the deal at the

end which is by hook or by crook that's

what you have to achieve your objective

otherwise there's no point in doing it

so yeah that's right

in sales and I'm gonna learn more about

closing the deal that's good thing um

you're gonna say yeah um but I agree

with you but I

make a point about it you have to be

very careful when you're deciding what

you want because you should never decide

on something and not be willing to take

something better so this is so if you

say for instance I want to go into this

talk wanting X you shouldn't close your

mind off to the possibility of Y which

is better than X and that's something

which you can often do if you go in and

you're so convinced on doing it and the

other thing to say as well is if you go

in trying to teach somebody something

and I specify their teaching but in lots

of situations what happens is you try

and teach them this thing and you start

to teach something else and they're

actually much more interested in that

thing or very you can use their passion

in that subject but you can't do that if

all you're trying to do is to teach X

and even as well as that you also have

to be really careful about seeming

disingenuous because if you're only

focused on you know selling them a thing

or on teaching them X then they're not

going to feel like you care and they're

not gonna learn X whereas if you're like

genuinely passionate about it and it's

like your goal is to teach them X but

you're still happy to do other stuff

you're much more likely to teach people

things yes can I agree with everything

you said then Tom they're all really

good points cannot but can I reframe if

I think I'm gonna break them into two

main areas

I want to reach because they're both

interesting the first one is being open

to doing something better and the second

one is be careful of seeming

disingenuous because that can undermine

your thing let's do them in reverse

order the disingenuous thing I actually

think what you're saying is really

important here it doesn't go to your

goal you still have the same goal you've

got to go in with a goal but the

question is how do you achieve your goal

and I would argue for any teacher or

communicator you have to one of the most

important things is getting the trust of

the person if you're trying to get them

to change and you cannot trick people

into trust unless you're amazing I don't

even think you can so you have to be

authentic so if you want to bring about

a change in someone it sort of goes with

the territory that you have to care

about them bring them on board make them

think you care about them

you can't trick them into that the only

way you can make someone think you care

about them is to actually care about

them so well unless you can work out

some other really clever way you know I

would lie to you guys I would I would do

all sorts of horrible things if I

thought it would help teach you because

my whole goal is at the end of this

course I want you to be a different sort

of person in some way I want you to have

changed in some way and I would do

anything to get that but my personal

experience has been the best way of

achieving that is to get you to trust me

a bit and think that I'm on your side

and really the only way of doing that is

actually that Trust has to be justified

and I have to genuinely be on your side

and one of the things I've got is this

honesty thing so I will never say

anything dishonest I will not lie to you

or try and trick anyone because I figure

that costs a little bit more at the

beginning and it's a bit of effort to

run that but once I've established that

relationship it actually helps me

achieve my goal so it's actually a bit

ruthless because at the end of the game

I just want to achieve this goal which

is I want you to go and be awesome and

changed in various ways I won't next you

may be at the end of the course I'll get

you to think about what my actual

objective in this course was because I

have a very precise one and I I do a

thing when I'm going in to give any talk

which is the sub objective for that talk

I repeat in my head just walk in I call

it the most important thing so as I'm

going and I think don't forget the most

important thing today is blah blah blah

and then no matter how much things go

off the rails and how much I forget in

her distraction we go gonna get to blah

blah blah we're gonna do blah blah blah

and this then now relates to your first

point on which I think is a really

interesting one oh the second one's fine

the second one's good too but um the

first point was be open to other things

that are better and I think in life

that's just a general good life lesson

don't be close-minded always be open and

in communication I would actually call

that the skill of listening so be very

good at listening to what's going on and

reading back not just presenting

ruthlessly and forgetting about what's

going on and be prepared to change what

you're doing but I don't think you

should change what you're doing if

you've got good goals I don't think you

should change what you're doing to

change your goals I think it's just sub

goals that will change so I have a

certain mindset I want you to have at

the end of the course but if I'm giving

the talk and someone doesn't like

something in someone like something else

I might change I will do something else

this lecture or here's a better way of

achieving that's a better

to all of that but I'm not open to at

the end of the course you guys just

learned some stuff forget a little and

go on you get a tick and get some marks

and move on I actually want you to be a

little bit different in some way I'm not

open to changing that as much but I

reckon I am pretty open so I reckon

you're right if halfway through the

course circumstances change what who

said that someone said that's a great

quote when when facts change ma'am I

changed my opinions what do you do

who says that someone found some

politician being inconsistent because

something had changed and he said well

if thinks it was Abraham Lincoln we love

Abraham Lincoln he's so cool so yeah

absolutely are you gonna be open you've

got a live an examined life the Socrates

would say you've got a constantly

thinking about things and changes we go

so absolutely time I really like the

principles behind what you're saying but

I hope you can also see that my goal is

normally so high level that even the

difference you're taking different

journeys and being open to that I'm

still doing it with this particular end

goal in mind yeah I think the high-level

part is the important part of that and

even sorry the other thing I'd say is

you know your goal may be to change our

minds at the at the end of the course

but if for instance the massive global

pandemic came along and meant that some

people weren't able to do that and you

interesting because you say you know

you'd do whatever it took to get that

goal I'm curious if you actually would

do whatever it took to get that goal I

like you guys too much I wouldn't do

anything um but but I just really do

passionately believe in that goal which

is I want you to say because I've said

it as a challenge to you to work out

what it is but I will tell you at the

end and it's a goal that I think is in

your interest but yeah I was thinking

even as I was talking before because I

just heard that my dad got sick again

and had to rush back to hospital you

know he had this heart operation we

thought everything was okay and I was

going back to hospital and he's all

stressed and I'm stressed and something

wrong with his heart

everything's yeah thanks um so you know

I only didn't give the lecture tonight

because they needed me to drive up and

pick him and drive to hospital but

luckily my wife chucked her work in and

raced off so she's a quite senior in an

organization that might have some

problems tonight because she did that

but um you know and I guess I would you

know got to be open to change you got to

you know I have a higher goal iam and

then hoping you

which is probably helping my dad so yeah

yeah yeah absolutely

be reflective I love that oh you know if

you just do something because you've set

your mind on doing it and you're not

constantly evaluating it then yeah

you're right that's great

okay so thank you you're I'm sure you

have this unjustified optimism in the

world but thank you um so yeah what if

we got objective change yeah you could

bring about change and attention so now

we're gonna start looking at the lower

level things as Tom pointed out this

thing I mentioned first is a very high

level thing you wouldn't even notice if

you didn't do it but I think if you

don't do it then your talk and your

teaching is just because it's just a

mess you know you just exit you've got a

net you've got a goal even if you don't

know it's just an accidental goal in

there and might as well have a

deliberate select Richard can I ask a

quick question oh shoot you keep using

communicate and teaching interchangeably

well it sounds interchangeably are you

saying they are interchangeable or is

the difference between that's a really

good point in my mind because I have my

whole life in thing I think of them as

the same so I think all communication is

like how I think all teaching is but I

buy the word teaching this is just a

little aside so you can just you know

for a second if you manage it by

teaching

I don't think teaching is perhaps what

other people might mean when they say

the word for me teaching is effective

communication it brings about change in

the students and it's about changing

students in ways that help them and help

the world hopefully so that involves

communication communication without

that's not teaching for me is almost

communication without change but there

is this patronizing connotation to

teaching that there's is teacher who

somehow wise or in a student who's

somehow less wise and one person is

acting on the other in a sort of non

reciprocal way and I don't think that

our teaching is I really think in this

course of 400 of us or so that there's

probably 401 teachers in here and 401

students because Who I am is largely an

amalgam of all the things all my

students have taught me over the years

many of them very very humbling lessons

so I don't think of it as a power thing

so but yeah I do

I do it's almost a like a Marxist

approach like

this Marxist approaches things are only

valid if they bring about change and/or

effect in some way and I sort of won't

laughing about this but um I do sort of

like that idea that something is just

entirely abstract and has no impact on

the world is yeah so yeah for me they're

the same but you can review them as

different things sure yeah I mean I

guess teaching is communication as a

tool used by teachers and the active

teaching is probably active goal

selection and then the communication is

how you carry it out and so probably you

can tease out a little bit more

distinction there so I should stop being

lazy with my words and be quite precise

so in communication then Thanks that was

really good in communication you can not

you can easily forget the first bit of

working at the big goal and you can do a

wonderful second bit but it's as I said

clangs and noise and symbols and

emptiness because who knows what it's

achieving and the example I want to give

there is the students that I was

observing in this course that I was

running the ones that had a clear

objective and gave a talk it was a

brilliant talk and was moving and I felt

it would have been effective and

appropriate for that scenario and the

ones that just viewed the scenario as

window dressing and they just gave the

same talk as if it had been at a funeral

or or trying to persuade a prime

minister to change or on the Titanic

trying to persuade this or or trying to

do this or you know if the context was

irrelevant then and they just gave a

funny talk or something then you know I

just found those talks a bit of a mess

and I thought at the end of it maybe

people are smiled and laughed but at the

end of it you've missed an opportunity

to do something I think um so they were

really good that was good and um I'm

even more impressed that you managed in

my non stop speaking to jam in

interjections please keep doing that and

if you sort of interject but I keep

talking because I haven't quite heard

you your picture flips to the front

anyway and suddenly I see you and then I

can see your interjecting and I will put

on the brakes and stop 200 metres down

the road so please just jump in and talk

that's great I maybe have a small

interjection

I understand that like in things like

prose

patient's and teaching and like lots of

different communication examples it's

super important to have a goal I also

wonder whether there's definitely some

situations where you're not trying to

necessarily bring about any change like

for example giving the wake at someone's

funeral you're not trying to change

anything so I was thinking of that I'm

so awake or at best

actually I think awake has an objective

and the objective of the Wieck is to

help people with their grieving to

acknowledge the person's you know impact

on the world not for them but for the

people you know I think a speech at

awake is for the people who are at the

wake not for the dead person and I think

I think it's really emotional and hard

time at a funeral

and when someone you love has died and

if someone can I found some talks at

wakes to be very comforting and have

helped me or made me think about the

person in a different way I remember my

at my grandfather's funeral some of you

it was a teacher - and some of anyway

people spoke about his teaching and that

was very profound for me and made me

think about him in a good way and took

away some of the sorrow because it made

me focus on some of the good things that

happen so I do think in a way you don't

want to do change in this sort of

patronizing way but you want to help

everyone grieve you want to you know you

have you have you do have objectives in

a wake I think if you're giving a talk

of a successful talk at the wake would

honor the person would make the people

feel that they were properly honored if

there's grieving widows would make them

feel that their partner was loved or

widowed as their wife was loved it was

important it would give meaning to it a

bit if it all seems a bit meaningless

you know help you find the meaning

because everyone's life has had many in

some way and changed other people inside

so I what do you think of that Lauren I

I do think there is some meaning yeah I

asked because I did one last year and I

didn't sit down and think here's my goal

you know like but I guess by knowing

someone you are you kind of into like

you put that in without really thinking

about it but you know I wasn't trying to

bring about change I did have objectives

but they weren't

about yeah anything in the present

situation yeah I think to honor the

person and yeah I don't know like the

other thing is that um you're never sure

like what people are going to actually

take away from any piece of

communication you gives like just take

like literary analysis as one example

like people draw up all kinds of all

kinds of interpretations from the way

you communicate so I think even by

having an objective like you can try and

achieve it but I don't know how how

successful you can be in ished ensuring

people take that away I think that's

they're both really good points and if I

can I would like to say something about

both of them because I think they're

worthy of response there's if I do a

reverse order again the literary

criticism one's interesting it's

certainly the case I think that the

words once said don't belong to the

speaker they belong to the listener and

the listener can take what they want

from them and I do know there's a form

of art where meaning is sort of denied

in a way and it's entirely constructed

in the listener and there's poems like

the poems by in Malley you know this

one's generated randomly from random

words where listeners still got value

from them and then others automatically

generated music that has no rhyme or

reason and and people still get value

from that so that's absolutely fine and

yeah I mean I could be wrong but but my

thought is the plays I like the most the

books I like the most the music I like

the most

has this coherence and beauty to it and

I don't have to accept it and sometimes

the things I love in it are there

accidentally because of just the nature

of the person who did it or the culture

they've come from other things like that

but I just think when you're talking if

you don't want to be random it's good to

have a goal I guess I yeah maybe I'm

gonna be naive a not-so post-money yeah

don't you I think if you're really

cynical about it everything has a goal

or at least you can make everything have

a goal but it's sometimes more that you

don't want to have a goal of

acknowledging that actually just feels

disingenuous like for instance I mean if

yours if you're giving a speech at a

lake or something you know you might

want you might not want to think about

the fact that you have a goal there to

help grieve and so forth you're just

trying to take part in that collective

experience and having this sort of

notion of what it's supposed to be is a

very sort of I don't know what the right

word for it is but it just feels wrong

or it feels like you shouldn't do that

almost yeah just I hear what you're

saying and I I am and I hear a similar

message from Lauren that in some sense

and a sort of unexamined in the flow

sort of thing might be an appropriate

sort of communication and maybe I'm just

too analytical or brain but just when

when I approach I mean I do like

switching off and not being analytical

it is a pleasure that's right then

perhaps in singing or something there's

no goal but I do think Lauren's point

about the wake is a well-constructed

wake speech I mean yes wake speech can

go off the rail or can be wrong you know

it can be about you rather the other

person it can be it can be inappropriate

in lots of ways or it can just not give

people the solace they need and I think

you probably know from the environmental

pressures and having been to things

before you sort of know that what the

goals are is Lauren said and maybe

you're following these girls without

even reflecting on them but I do think

they should always you know for me as a

construct a creator I like so he's his

Richard's personal idea about how to

communicate please communicate however

you like absolutely that's fine but I I

do find that when when there is thought

an order and planning put into something

that very beautiful and powerful things

can be created that I don't sometimes

see happening without flow and Lauren I

think you had something else you want to

say I can see you sort of twitching is

in

good yeah yep um maybe just have a look

at the the chat it's going crazy oh

that's fantastic

all right oh well I will have a look at

the check look if you had to think of

something that almost has no goal or

meaning it's a best man speech in there

pretty hard to a best man speech a

response from the but I'm sure there's a

response from either person so I

shouldn't say bad best person maybe

because my best person was a woman I

mean so in those speeches it is hard to

know what they want and what they should

be but I think even then there is a

little bit of a goal going on so I would

encourage you especially when you're in

this security and you're a professional

and you're having some sort of

professional conversation are the

managing up or down or dealing with your

team or trying to bring about something

that you are probably motivated in those

circumstances by trying to bring about a

change even if you can't articulate it

and I'm encouraging you to articulate

and I'm just about to now I'll talk

about the low level ways of going about

carrying out that high level goal but

still encouraging you even that seems

disingenuous and insincere and all sorts

of things to have a high level goal

first huh so many someone's gone nuts I

can see all these comets coming in um

here we go what's happening what

someone's someone's typing an actual

exploit in the comments okay here we go

so action things you can do to

communicate effectively one these are

like a low level things notice that you

can only impact someone and get into

their head if they're listening and

you've got their attention and attention

so it's very tenuous thing you're gonna

get it for a short period of time I'm

sure I've lost different attention now

it's a it's a little joy you get of the

first few minutes or first few seconds

when you've got everyone's attention and

it's a precious resource and you've got

to use it and you either keep the

attention or you lose it and as soon as

you lose it you've lost it okay it's

very hard to get back so attention is a

scarce resource assume then that you

only have it for a brief period of time

I think

research shows I remember does anyone

know this stats on this when people go

for jobs job interviews eye tracking

indicates that people have made up their

mind about where they're going to

appoint someone or not very very quickly

does anyone know how quickly people make

that decision

others Christine hey Chris

hey Kevin you gonna say something

30 seconds yeah it's it I think I think

it's even less than second 30 seconds

Tom I can't see you for comment on the

wrong screen

so I

- by the comments then that's really

funny so yeah it is within seconds so I

think you you only have a short window

of opportunity so make good use of that

and one thing I see people doing an

ineffective talks and maybe it's because

you're taught to do this at school is

its constructed bottom-up so programmers

know what I'm talking about here an

ineffective communication tends to start

like this here's a bit here's something

else here's something else here's

something else here's something else

here's something else oh you can combine

those things yet this combine those

things I said before to get this to put

those two things together this and then

an hour later - digital by the

conclusion the reason I was talking to

you I finally reached the conclusion

it's like a surprise I didn't want to

tell you our from where we're going and

now we've got there and you look around

the room and there's like three people

left and they're amazed at this surprise

conclusion you've got - but of the 400

you started with you've only got three

left so effective communication we've

got a fight for someone's attention and

attention scarce resources put the most

important thing first because you're

going to lose them before you get to

there and don't write your things like

it's a missed murder mystery and you

going to do a big reveal in the last

paragraph do the big reveal in the first

paragraph then all the stuff that

justifies it and then do it again at the

end because I'll have forgotten that

again so the idea is and you'll see

American comedians often follow this

thing tell them what you you're going to

say then say it and then tell them what

you just said but don't talk talk talk

talk talk and then the end tell them

what you said all that stuff people love

stories so if you're going to construct

a good talk I would suggest you learn a

lot about narrative and look at how

stories work stories like having arcs

it's like if they're like I'm in

character they like having a motion

people are addicted to stories you know

I think we've had an oral story oral

storytelling tradition going back

forever and it's probably a really

important part of why we have language

stories just really appeal to us and I

mean Jesus all sort of parables it's a

very effective way of teaching used to

blow me away when I'd read the things he

said I think he's just telling stories

it's so much more interesting that he

preached at me with lists of numbers and

rules if he tells me a story about stuff

that's really cool

so I do think stories are powerful

and learning about how to tell stories

and how stories work is a great skill

for any communicator and then you should

try and incorporate as much of that

storytelling skill and craft can tell

you talk because I think our brains are

sort of wired up to understand it I

think I was reading recently is this

right they found a quiz in a Neanderthal

or an early some early hominin cave

paintings that look like their stories

and like there's like some there's just

like this year I've seen it some

ridiculously old evidence of early

storytelling through cave paintings or

some sort of painting that's been

preserved so acronyms oh yeah objective

so if you want the point of your

communication is to get someone to say

yes to something like I've spoken at my

local council trying to get them to

change some piece of law or not pass a

piece of law or do something else

sometimes I speak in front of groups

where I want them to decide to do

something under decide not to do

something sometimes I speak at academic

board once when the Vice Chancellor was

new to the uni had a big public forum

called a Town Hall and he was talking

about all the things he wanted to do and

one of the things he wanted to do I

thought was not not quite right and I

thought I'm gonna get I'll put my hand

up there we have thousand people in

there if I'm lucky I'll get picked if I

get picked I'll lose everyone's

attention in like three seconds and

he'll have already made his mind up and

he won't really be listening to what I'm

going to say and I thought how can I be

impactful here and I thought I've got to

have a killer example that I can say in

about three seconds

that's funny because humor just

instantly adds the stickiness but the

example is so telling and so emotionally

loaded that everyone's gonna completely

agree with the example and it's going to

be this really clear analogy with this

thing it's gonna be sticky and catching

in a way so they'll go away from the

talk and they'll still remember that

example and I planned that one little

interjection that must have looked like

I was just telling a joke and I'd

randomly stuck my hand up I must have

put eight or nine hours into planning

that little 1/32 thing I said because it

was so important so yeah

storytelling very important work out how

to be objective now if you want someone

to say yes to something

you're gonna make it easy for them to

say yes so you want to persuade your

boss to change the company's funding

policy so you can get more funding for

cyber or you want to persuade one other

division to have some onerous new

privacy requirement on them or you wanna

do you want on someone to say yes okay

we'll do that you have to make it easy

for them to say yes because people are

tired and busy and distracting they've

got a million things to do and if I told

you all this it's really good thing we

could do you could simultaneously think

oh that would be really good I wish we

could do that and also think that's a

pain though that's a lot of work so I

think we'll probably just stick with

what we're doing but I agree Richard

that would have been a good idea if we

done that so that's your real danger if

you've got a good idea so how can you

get someone to say yes and buy into the

good idea well I find you have to do a

bit of work for them because if it looks

like saying yes to you means they've got

to do work it's very hard for them to

say yes but if you've done all the work

for them and there's nothing to do other

than saying yes then they're more likely

to say yes so I remember counsel there

was we're objecting to something I think

there were 20 or 30 objections from

around the neighbourhood to this one

thing and the council patiently listened

to all the objections but when I gave my

objection I said Dada Dada and he's a

good thing and he's a bad thing about it

but I think this is really important to

change and we could change it just by

changing these three words here in the

consent from this to that and I hear

some evidence said that would be good

and you know what happened the council

thank everyone for coming they

acknowledged everything everyone said

but they went ahead and approved the

whole thing anyway but they made that

three word change because it was easy

they say oh we vote for that change and

they thought they've done something and

they listen to us a little bit so you

predigested and you have the thing you

want them to do ready do not go to

someone and give them a yes/no question

we're saying yes is going to involve

them is going to be difficult for them

make it easy for them to say yes all

right

acronyms so an acronym is when you say

the letters for something why do people

say acronyms what do you guys think

why would someone in a conversation say

an acronym why would I say PKI I can see

Lauren's leaning forward but other

people talk to Lauren not trying to stop

you from leaning forward makes it sound

makes you sound fancy Joe you've said it

look and that was a really clever piece

of communication so I was a little bit

funny so if it had been wrong you

wouldn't have felt silly because we sort

of would have all laughed and it was

good and it was also you're putting

yourself down a little bit when you're

funny so is not this state it's just a

very that was a really nice response and

it was spot-on

and you said it in quirky words it was

just it makes you something yeah it's

it's it's status signaling or competent

signaling I remember when I used to

start teaching computer just computer

programming years ago you get these

people in the class and then and before

the first class I just sit in the

audience and listen while everyone was

filing in because I say oh no it'll look

like a student now and someone would sit

next and then just start sort of

bragging and they're dragged by using

these acronyms and it'd be this like

game for one of them to say something

the other one didn't know and as long as

each knew what the other one was saying

was like I could imagine to elq's with

enormous big horn sort of bashing

against each other acronyms are way

signalling that you know stuff and if

you don't know the acronym you're locked

out so it's actually a bit of a group

thing it's like a similar or how do you

pronounce it you should look that up

it's really cool so the idea is it's

something that shows that you're in the

group and for people outside the group

they can't hear it and they can't

understand what you're saying and

actually acts to keep them out it's not

helpful in any communication at all

sometimes in documents people use they

pronouns because it keeps it shorter so

you don't have to write so much but

actually he's a confusion people often

have the same confusion when they wrote

a computer program the objective of a

computer program isn't up for it to be

sure the objective of a computer program

is for it to be awesome which means it

works it's easy to modify it it's a joy

to read it's you know you know add extra

functionality if there's a mistake in it

it stands out there your objectives in

running a program no one ever said make

it short and make it short is sometimes

a consequence of meeting those

objectives but it's not the driver and

it's the same in a sentence so if it

takes me a bit longer to say something

but when I say it you understand what I

mean and I can say it a bit shorter but

you don't understand what I mean then it

really wasn't I mean if you think about

you the speaker and communication is all

about your speaking I guess it could

look like it's a twin but if you think

about the listener and their

understanding it's a loss so I wouldn't

almost never say an acronym I mean

what's the point of it makes people

sound stupid if they ask for it

and when you got the public service they

speaking Akram's all the time it's very

you should do this it's a homework for

you somehow go into the public service

somehow zoom bomb a public service

meeting and just listen to them talk and

see how many acronyms they are it is

it's similar still technically

depressing and funny so a communication

tip number 17 I think we're up to is no

acronyms please now everything should

have a beginning a middle and an end so

structure your talks and your

presentation so there's beginning middle

and end beginning set things up the

middle does the stuff and the end

summarizes at all make sure you have

those three parts always if you're

trying to persuade someone begin from

agreement so start from somewhere where

you will agree don't start by talking

about the problem you'll have start by

here's common ground we have we all like

this we all want us to be a success

there are some challenges with we do it

this way we could do it their way but

start from agreement

don't use acronyms are select names

twice and some examples are lots of

examples here here are some just because

how I learned to communicate is by just

copying and by oh and record yourself

always and play it back later on and

listen through other people's ears so

you can see how good you are and I used

to also put spies in all my talks and

lectures

my sister-in-law used to do it or

friends or former students just get

people to hide in the lecture I remember

my sister and I used to do when she was

14 or 15 where she was visiting Sydney I

just smoked her into the back of

lectures and at the end saying how did

that go

what did you think and then she would

give me this completely on because you

know she just said it like it was she'd

say you know you loved the right side of

the room and you never look at the left

side of the room I was on the left side

of room I felt really lonely so anyway

yeah listen to yourself notice here are

things you can do to work out how to

communicate there is this incredible

book I don't know if anyone's read up by

Scott MacLeod called understanding comic

where he understood where he analyzes

how comics communicate and tell stories

and he does it in terms of a comic it's

a graphic novel about how to understand

graphic more it's just so beautiful when

you read that it's humbling and it tells

you all about storytelling

he's written other one called making

comments comic sense good to rig the

book win friends and influence people

that is an amazing book it's nearly a

hundred years old now and it's still

awesome I only hope it doesn't get

coronavirus it is who I wrote it down

can you write a couple other books as

well but this

is the killer one win friends and

influence people sound cynical and

sarcastic but it's actually really

lovely and then I have a stack of books

that I knocked on the floor let me now

do a show-and-tell

as we approach our first break so you

can relax now I'm just going to show you

some books that I think are really good

examples of communication on this one ad

it should have you seen utopia

Oh

sounds like so here is brilliant and

that um are you able to share screens

Oliver um I'm gonna show this I want to

show this video that you might have seen

already it's called something to change

makers or something like that

it's almost could have been taken out of

utopia it's an advertisement made by the

public service encouraging people to

come and work in the public service it

is I think the classic example of didn't

and full of the worst communication ever

invented if you could find that we'll

show it in a few minutes but if you

can't that's fine

all right here we are here are my

examples of good communication all right

best this book here and so it's got a

bit better this is an awesome book good

Alicia bark internal mental golden

braids Eddie it tries to explain

something that's almost completely

incomprehensible you really it's

advanced well its goals incompleteness

theorem so it's formal logic and it's

quite advanced formal logic yet this

book can be written by read by a

teenager don't read the first chapter

the introduction that's a little bit

depressing and hard skip over that

straight into the book the book itself

could be read by anyone and at the end

of it accidentally you've learnt

girdle's incompleteness room and along

the way you've learnt all about

MC Escher you've read all these funny

stories you've played games you've just

been enticed and enhanced and

entertained you don't realize you're

learning and you get to the end you know

the whole thing everything I do in my

teaching is copied and stolen from this

brilliant man who's such a great

communicator he makes learning fun he

don't even notice you're doing it I love

it so much so that's a great example of

good communication I'm inspired by that

here this book here a little history of

the world

by this German guy it's amazing he wrote

it's just a summary of history it misses

out all sorts of things

it's very anglocentric or

western-centric um but it's just

brilliant and you read this and you

understand a whole lot of history that

you never understood before and he wrote

it essentially for 10-year olds so it's

written for 10-year olds it's written

it's so clear it's just amazing it blows

me away as a piece of clear

communication has anyone actually read

this or seen this book before no oh are

you so like you should get a copy you

can knock it over in like ten seconds

and you'll know all this stuff and

you'll understand the history of the

world and the reason because it was so

good a lot of people have copied it

there's lots of books that spring up

like this said of a little history of

the world a little history of science

this is a terrible book Oh Joanne did

you hit something you want to say

that's if you do come back that's yeah

little history of science so he sort of

copied the cover and the title and his

coffees of format inside but he doesn't

copy the communication style so reading

these two books side by side makes it

really clear what what's going on in

terms of good and bad communication they

look so similar and there's lots of

there's lots of little history books I

haven't seen another one that's a patch

on this original money okay a brief

history of time and that sort of reminds

me similar concept but Stephen Hawking

is a really good writer so he sort of I

think he did it successfully Stephen

Hawking Cal Sagan there are we do we've

been blessed with communicators thank

you this is the best graduation speech

ever given

it's called Greg and congratulations by

the way luckily someone recorded it and

wrote it down it's tiny you can just

read it on the internet it's free but I

got the book because it's such a good

book you can give it to anyone as a

Christmas present and they'll be happy

forever it is literally the best speech

ever

I sometimes often ask you to say I

sometimes I'm asked to give graduation

addresses in institutions and when I do

well now I actually find it hard to give

them because I think well the best one

in the world's already been given what

can I give it just a power reflection on

that but that's another time when I do a

big analysis of what are my objectives

had a graduation speech and over the

years I've slightly tweaked what the

objectives are maybe I'll put some of my

graduation speeches up and you can look

at them if you want to just see and try

and double guess what I'm trying to

achieve in them but this one here this

one ever you can really intend second

available online for free he later on

went to be a famous sauce that he wrote

linking in the banner but at the time he

wrote this he was just a guy um the

little prince of course and by this

pilot who I love more than anything he's

written all sorts of amazing books and

they're so beautiful

so a little prince is a great example

good communication this book here I told

you to riddle in the first week I hope

you've all read it this is the Edition I

like the most I think this is a second

edition there's a big Edition that's

come out but this is little you see I

like little and it's short and concise

and it's just beautiful

and it will help you be a great

communicator a written communicator but

the ideas in it will also help you verb

communication it's persuasive as well so

after reading it not only do you have

the techniques to be a good communicator

but you really want to be so and I find

win friends and influence people's have

been like that too um this book here

look at the wise I bought this from the

states in hardcopy

it's an old library copy you can't get

up for level money I can't even remember

how much it cost me it was a fortune

it's out of print it is the most amazing

book ever I might read you a story from

or one day it's so beautiful um it's a

Japanese essentially Solomon type story

you're telling the wisdom of a judge in

Japan um it's a story for judges really

and then novels what novels are well

communicated well you'll all have your

own ideas but I find john lecarre a

communicates really well and I find

Patrick O'Brien communicates really well

and I find it's a little going crazy

especially these really early books

you're right but are so short I can't

believe you read this book it's like

reading a poem you've read 17 pages or

how long it is at the end your whole

world is filled with the universe begin

star wars and I went through once and

did an analysis of how she wrote and how

each chapter relates to each other

chapter annals

the structuring is bringing up so it is

possible to communicate well and it's

possible to do a Mis and if you pick up

a random book I find often a system miss

but these I think each of the things I

put up then was very carefully planned

and maybe as Laura and Tom pointed out

this is my bias and I like centralized

planning and and things but they all

right so they're my written examples and

spoken if you want to learn how to give

a good speech I always think you should

steal from other people it's very hard

to work things out for yourself

so I copy other people so when I started

talking I just made a mission of going

through and listening to the great

speeches from history to try and think

about how they were constructed and put

together and what their objectives were

and here are some of them I write a list

of my favorite ones down here where are

they

Sermon on the Mount I think is amazing

it's amazing

I like the values in it actually doing a

lot of Christian stuff on me if I knew

other religions I've talked about them

too I'm sure they've got great speeches

but the sermon on the ground is just the

Mount is really well constructed and

it's really quite persuasive and it's

really simple and he's addressing his

audience really effectively it is a

bring a piece of aeration I think as

well as I quite like the values in it

the Gettysburg Address so that's the

talk that Lincoln gave at the memorial

service Kitty's burg he was a president

he wasn't even supposed to give the talk

I think I can't remember all the details

but because something like think there

was there some Republican or whoever it

was the two sides he was not a Democrat

he was the other one I don't know if

though the Republican signal called

something else and he there was some

squabbling between them and some reason

he wasn't coming I think now people say

was invited because they thought he

wouldn't come but anyway there was some

hoo-ha and they invited someone else to

give the talk to commemorate the battle

at Gettysburg I'm so many dead people

it's almost like a wake speech learn

it's that sort of sort of thing we were

talking about before I hadn't thought of

that before anyway the official speaker

came first and spoke for two hours and

then Lincoln stood up and said like ten

sentences I don't have any I should have

counted like nothing like it was just a

couple of minutes and it was the most

amazing speech it's unbelievable there's

this myth that went around for a while

that he wrote it on the train while he

was coming in but evidence seems to

suggest that's not the case and I think

it's not the case because I've given

lots of speeches and when you see

something small and beautiful it's

because someone's taken something big

and horrible and put a lot of time into

it to make it small and beautiful it is

a lovely speech I would read through

that and analyze that and that inspired

me a lot in my early days about just how

to give a speech elements of flow of

relationship of linking of closing a

call-outs at the beginning and end

linking together just all the structure

of it is just really beautiful so you

should read it and think about why it's

so great the to our one who remembers

that the short one mazing blow us all

away he wasn't giving that

for the people there he was giving that

speech for the whole country he was

giving that speech it was a good speech

when it was printed in the papers later

it wasn't this really good speech on the

day no one could hear her you know no

it's paying attention for respect that

one on another two-hour talk then they

got a ten-second one you know so but he

wasn't he was thinking I want to do

something that's going to actually

change in the nation and it did an

amazing talk to Gettysburg Address what

else have we got though I have a dream

speech

Socrates apology something I love

Socrates apologies a great speech just

you know everything Socrates well we

don't have know what he said we only

know what his students write down about

what he said that man never published

he'd never survived from the University

today but what an amazing man so yeah

you might want to read the apology

Churchill gave all these incredible

speeches and of course we're thinking

about them now as we go into the

coffered situation so yeah

pick your favorite Churchill speeches

and listen to them because he had a

mission in every one of the speeches he

go there was a reason for giving it and

he had an objective and he achieved it

and they weren't manipulative objectives

they were I mean he was working for a

noble cause guarantees do or die speech

is amazing and he's amazing

alright there's lots of other ones even

the one small step for mankind that's

pretty good so look at the things that

have been effective communications for

you look at how people do it and try

copy them you will not ever communicate

well just by accident or by just

throwing things together because it

seems to work it needs a lot of planning

there's a famous quote that someone said

I mean Oscar Wilde or someone else I was

going to write you a short letter but I

didn't have time so he's a long one

instead the idea being to make something

concise structured planned and well

organized to have a good communication

that takes a lot of time and effort in

planning ok um how did you go Oliver did

you find it I found something but I'm

really not sure if it's a piss-take on I

paid money for this that's the perfect

description of it it's um I'm just about

to go flat so I'm just gonna put my

opinion it's a piece of communication

that's so bad you can't actually believe

it was made are you able to share your

screen

yeah one sec I joined a little life

what's this horrible speech oh we're

just about to see an example of poor

communication and this is a I'll tell

you at the end but it's a real ad put

out by the public service can you say

that it's come up on my screen as it

come up on everyone else's the

GameTrailers yeah oh you guys you gotta

watch this go go go into the executive

this afternoon it's been a massive

challenge but definitely looking forward

to it

hey guys I'm just heading downstairs my

Paleo parent banana bread would you like

to join me no thanks it's a little bit

fancy for me I'm actually after an

average I'm torn Strait Islander stuff

Network lady okay

but how are you finding the program

pretty great to be honest I've been here

less than a year and never thought that

I'd be working on a project supporting

the modernization program across

government awesome

I'm working on a project in property and

construction hey are you looking for the

young leaders there with dinner tonight

yeah wouldn't be said the last one was

great okay David I hadn't look at your

are all really looking forward to the

great presentation this arvo thanks

David no pressure or anything

hey I got this boy how'd you choose gray

it's a real game changes up had some

fantastic reports about their work I've

certainly hit the ground running well

actually I should say fruity I put two

graduates working on project in my

division and they've just had such a

great impact on the team terrific it's

really great there is some talk to

executives like that yeah totally

hi guys I feel really good about my part

of the presentation with executive this

afternoon so here's a good cellphone

e-learning it's really helped me hey

buddy sorry I could do that every time

it's because we're in the Buddy Program

have you had to run through all the

other grants

yeah we have one yesterday at lunch time

so I'm gonna make it so we just got them

in but it also used to be coming

together they're great can't wait to

hear all about it

good luck buddy see ya

hi guys so if you finalized in your

presentation yeah I merely been looking

forward to it music hey don't you mentor

Jenna don't you I do yes I think her

capabilities would be a really good

match with my dancer team can you salsa

rapper see if she's interested sure I'm

actually singing in this afternoon so

I'm definitely around the pasture right

thanks see ya hey Jenna

I just had a couch at 13 and she asked

me you would be interested in joining

the budget search - what do you think is

gonna be brilliant

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

about two noon everyone right to see you

on sample

we've had lots of positive feedback

about your work across the different

projects from my first look I can see

that you've built many of the schools

that I know will stand you in good stead

for future opportunities whether here in

finance or elsewhere in the APS many of

the ideas you've come up with a real gun

charges with that in mind we at the

board are looking forward to seeing your

detail presentations

[Applause]

[Music]

what do you guys think words salad

that's all I'll say doesn't make you

want to come work in the public service

I mean you could really be a

game-changer that sounds a great way to

make a dko year and get absolutely

nothing done and I think that's my my

sort of fit you know it didn't actually

show any game changing they do the

highest all I got was they got to meet

executives this paleo pear and banana

bread we're definitely going to have

that in this course someone said I think

her capability would be a really good

match I think your capability would be a

really good match with something that's

so I'm gonna say that to you that's

gonna be my feedback or something you're

handing or on your exam or something

like that how do you it is very very

funny Oh

and I certainly hit the ground running I

should say sprinting so what's funny

about that communication well what was

its purpose I don't think anyone

articulated the purpose if the purpose

was to get smart people to come and work

for the Department of Finance then

obviously it's a complete fighter

because no one smart watching that would

want to work there you just think well

I'm wasting my life I'm not doing

anything real I'm just walking around

singing executives all day you know I'm

not actually making the world better in

any way so I don't think that was its

purpose I think the purpose of it was

you know it's just clearly to make the

executive look good and feel good the

Secretary of the Department got to

appear in her some higher blade he got

to appear in her you know they got to

talk about how awesome they were and how

they had Aboriginal and Torres Strait

Islanders there and they're just sort of

which is signaling and it's just like

you know I was just you know it would

have been something the ad agency showed

the firm the organization the

organization would have felt good about

themselves but the point of the

communication one would get other people

to join you

and I just think it was a complete

failure um but yeah it's too good to be

a parody it's actually better than

utopia what do you reckon

utopia was that Chandler come on I feel

like what happened was that like this ad

agency came up and like we should we

should do an ad and then everyone was

like oh yeah let's all be in it's like

fun video that we can all make and then

yeah yeah no one ever thought what are

we trying to do with this so yeah it was

fun to make I think that's right

here at the script I mean it was just

all it was truly did anyone think it was

does anyone have anything to say about

it

what it tells us about communication

always okay so I guess um but les you

say it the battle I think it's done a

good job I mean people are talking about

the Department of Finance more than they

would have without their dad that's

actually a warning it's like a cattle

grid it's like um sometimes people say

this with spam not spam with bad social

engineering emails like massive phishing

emails they're badly written and they've

got bad grammar and they're just so

obviously a scam and it's serves to stop

smart people from replying to the scam

people so only complete its a filtering

process I think of it as like a cattle

grid you know cattle grids are things

that only the cattle can walk the cattle

can't walk across it but cows can drive

across certain people can so cattle grid

stock cattle but not anyone else and

they said maybe is a cattle grid for the

sort of people they don't want to come

along or maybe it was put in by a good

person to keep you guys had to keep my

students out of it maybe I made that ad

so yeah yeah just not a lot in the

comment so that the description of the

video there was a link to the Sydney

Morning Herald or whoever would publish

that basically saying like experts react

to this ad yes and they must have done

an article at some point on it and

absolutely ripped into it cuz yeah it

was

it wasn't even that I didn't even find

that on the government page I found that

unlike anyone Harold you can bet this

has been buried

it says likes Como's original Lara

Bingle

Owen no I made it once to admit it was

made but yeah all about would you mind

just posting need precise URL you use

for that version of it in the notes

because I'd like to go down and hunt for

that article see because it'd be really

interesting to read an analysis from

someone who's analyzed it properly yes

in the trumpet in the notes but I just

found the just click to the article when

the title is this hilarious federal

department this hilarious yeah federal

Department of Finance video maybe the

worst so pretty good maybe it was all an

elaborate plan and they were actually

making it so bad so that it would get so

much media coverage and have so many

people watch it yeah yeah that's right

maybe maybe it was made by the New

Zealand Department of Finance maybe it's

a false flag operation no okay yes yes

yes there could be all sorts of

Machiavellian things going on but they

do say he never put down two conspiracy

things that can be put down to stupidity

the last thing I wanted to say I just

had two little funny examples what was

that what that one was

oh this was a - Ronnie skit oh yeah so

there's a youtube link there if you go

to it it's a - Ronnie's skit about it's

a communication one and what I I'm just

trying to now do the call out at the end

so we've reached the end and I'm now

referring to the thing I mentioned at

the beginning because it was most

important thing which is don't forget

that to communicate effectively you need

to think about the mind of the person

hearing it not about yourself um so in

this - Ronnie's one you see how one

person saying something and the other

person is hearing something else that's

very funny in clever because they're

always very clever and then there's the

palm with ear - does anyone know this

poem very famous one by the guy who did

let's talk Strine it's making fun of the

Australian accent made by an Australian

of course it's a poem and it has a

different meaning to the speaker and the

hearer or to the reader and the author

anyone read what the first line actually

says the title of the poem is without

you

yes without you without you I can hardly

live in a hedge you can only live there

let you and I live I bet you I can

hardly live and let you

I can hardly live without you yeah yeah

yeah see if we can read it and I dream a

badger kisses snot and die so yes

communication is about what the person

he is not about what you say okay now I

wanted to talk about the job application

so I've put a link on the side to the

job application um

can I share my screen I might just share

the screen here we go are you able to

see the screen of run oh this is my hips

better now I get to see a whole lot of

people's faces oh thank you everyone for

putting your camera's on that's really

cool Oh Richard yeah if you right-click

you can like press show video ah

right click what on like all the webcams

make co-host yeah but I will try that

later on but at the moment I can see

everyone cool which is just amazing so

that would be what a right-click would

give me normally all right it's really

nice to see you well I think if you

click on the three little dots on

anyone's image one of the options is

show video only

I'd non-video participants yeah it's got

to be an on video participant oh you

can't click on any one that you webcams

on yeah yeah okay that's really good

thanks guys this is really helpful

Thanks um okay job application so can

you just nod because I can see nods

instantly can you see the web am i

showing the webpage yep thanks guys so

[Music]

so you've all been working on the job

application and we've um you know we've

gone through crazy times so I just

thought I'd tell you what we're looking

for is you now reach last week or two of

the thing and you've got to write the

damn thing up so what to do

you can write a java application it's

five brief pages four pages on one page

and it's got all the evidence you've

been keeping throughout term and all the

things you've done and you can really

read about this yourself I just wanted

to go down the different areas so what

you've got to do basically I think we

said this early on is you've we want to

see evidence we want you to make a claim

you're going for this job so there's an

actual head you can click and get to the

actual not that it's relevant but I just

put it in here's the actual ad which I

stole from words from other heads and

reassembled them it's a for a company

called gets on and it's what they're

looking for and these are all words from

real ads

I just assembled into one Oh most of it

was based on a Google let's go you don't

need to read that but it's fun just so

you realize this is actually what people

are looking for when they hire people

all the stuff that you're going to write

now on your job application so you're

going to write an application or you

could call it a portfolio which is five

pages one page for each of five things

and each of those pages is just going to

summarize one area and the area are the

things that they said they're looking

for in the job in so the five things

were

um relevant technical skills so let's go

through them one at a time and just talk

about what we're looking so for Ridgid

relevant technical skills you've just

got to talk about the skills you've got

what you've got what you can do what you

know and then you talk about that a

little bit and then all your claims are

demonstrated by evidence so you could

say I've learned how to do this as

evidence here's a project I did in the

photograph of it or I'm good at this I

learned how to crack these codes as

evidence he's my getting all these

activities are done in learning the test

codes I know about this I've got this

technical skill he's someone commenting

on a door he's a he's a lightning

presentation I did on it or he is a blog

where a reflector or something like that

so just make claims about what technical

skills you've acquired in the course and

then give evidence demonstrating you

have a quite those skills second thing

they're looking for is that you've got a

security mindset so it's about how you

think how you approach life how you

approach the world it's mainly about

having security eyes and being analytic

all the time so what are we looking for

I'm mentioning all the evidence you can

do instead stuff about he blogs that's

off about this it's quite long because

I'm giving lots of things you could do

I'm not expecting you're gonna do all

these things I'm expecting you to have

one page which is called security

mindset and you're going to make a

couple of claims about why you think

you've got a security mindset and in

what ways you think you've got a

security mindset and then for each of

those claims you're going to say for

example this I talked about this for

example I blogged about this for example

I learned this and did this project

here's a picture about link time so your

page will just be a summary of if you

were going through the job and you knew

they wanted to have bond with the

technical skills what would you tell

them they say well sit down come in we

think your capabilities might be a good

match for this role can you tell us

about your technical skills and then

they all sit back with arms cross

waiting Peter talk what are you going to

say well hopefully you say I can do this

and I can do that no no a little bit of

crypto and I learned how to do this and

I know how to do this and they're here

in my five areas and then for each of

them you

some sort of example of how come you

could at that area or somethin in that

area because no one ever wants to hear

you toilets see something if there's a

question and they say what have they

claimed to have done then what's the

evidence of it and then what's the

impact of what they've done so if you

just talk about all the things you've

done you fill out the first column and

the other two are blank and you just

because we want all the columns feel

that so we want someone to talk about

what they're you know the skills they've

got and then the middle column is they

talk about all the things they've done

with that proving that they haven't

evidence that they do not just making it

up and then in the last one some sort of

demonstration that you've got impact and

you've used it well and and it's had a

big impact influence and what it's led

to in terms on time because when you

employ people you only what people are

gonna bring about change so you always

ask you know so so doctor doc what have

you done with it what's happened with it

um so that's your or security mindset

so that's anything you've noticed

anything stuff you're posted in security

everywhere you've reflected any blog

about how you change new things you've

noticed anything you've done that

demonstrates your security mindset so if

I said hey tell me about that you've got

a secure montane you could say sure yeah

I love security I built all these

projects and whenever I walk around like

there's no security floors he's

something funny I noticed at the bank

the other day and then sometimes when I

noticed things they reported to the

people and they change it he is some

suggestions I made for how someone can

change something here's an email that

they are back saying that they have

changed it so whatever you want you

don't have to do it all otherwise it'd

be a nightmare you've just got to do

something and then support it with some

evidence if you do one thing

whoa that's good if you can find three

or four that's fantastic okay um working

with others so we need you to be able to

work with others so we need you to have

good teamwork good communication skills

yeah we say community building there

that's a mistake isn't it because

there's a whole category for community

building further on I think professional

skills that you do ethical behavior so

talk about how you've worked with other

people how you've done teams now you've

you yeah how you've worked with that

that's all the different ways you've

work with others in this course or in

general over this period of time and

then another thing we want in the same

category of your what's this working

with others ability working with others

confused oh no that's just working with

others there's a community thing and

then self-management that's the next one

so proving you can manage yourself and

make things happen and organize things

you're not a shambolic mess like me so

showing you've got good time management

skills that you engage in professional

ethical behavior and here's a talk of

here's a list of some of the things you

might want to show for that do you have

have you delivered and planned

successfully projects that's the last

one you're something awesome so yeah the

last thing in the criteria was show that

you've actually can carry out some sort

of project and you've done some

impressive so here you talk about your

security or you so what you did that you

carried off the problems you heard how

you overcame them and how you still

managed to get something now I should

say I've talked been sharing with a

couple of people about their security

everywhere that there's something

awesomes no one's going to actually

achieve

what I wanted to achieve or if you did

you maybe your girls weren't ambitious

enough I mean you're gonna be a little

bit disappointing yourself and that's

awesome because that means you're

ambitious and you you're reaching your

grasp don't accept they line up and

that's fine and I I like that and that's

gonna be the rest of your life probably

you're seeing a pattern of that and

that's absolutely okay you're just gonna

learn how to deal with that so make sure

you don't end up with nothing although

you don't achieve everything you wanted

make sure you end up with something work

out some sort of minimum fallback thing

you end up with and then make sure

there's reflection about what went wrong

and how you can fix it and ideally the

reflection doesn't all just happen at

the end how blue been grappling with

this for a while and just so that you've

thought about it and just talk about the

good things you have done and talk about

how you do things differently if you do

them again and that's pretty awesome I

think you most people can be quite hard

on themselves with this something

awesome it's awesome if you've set out

to do something ambitious and it's

awesome if you've achieved something

ambitious and you don't have to achieve

every single ambitious thing it's about

to do even just achieving one teaching

stuff one new thing and building one

thing that were a little bit well that's

impressive well much better than someone

just sit around doing nothing that's

absolutely a little bit awesome so well

done that's a sort of really good mark

for delivery method like let's say like

we didn't probably didn't achieve like

all of our criteria so its HD would we

get some marks for a good presentation

yes I'll talk about the marking in a sec

but yeah it's not an all-or-nothing you

get marks for whatever you've done so

the if your presentation is good then

that goes towards your communication

skills which is one part of portfolio

for the something awesome we're looking

at we're trying to find out what you

actually did that was awesome but if it

didn't work and you did recovery or some

fallback strategy that's awesome too and

you'd also mention that in your

portfolio for project time management

you do you want me to show you the

actual marking something awesome

something awesome what we want to say

and then I listed things I tried to give

examples of things you could put for

each category I'm not trying to give you

more work here I'm just trying to make

suggestions or things you could put in

that might help you so here's the things

we'd like to see in each category these

nice things but you don't have to have

more I don't want you to view this as

of obligations on you I want you to view

this as uh oh my god I have no idea what

to write for the self management section

it's so stressful and then oh no here

some things like it right so view it as

a help and you don't have to do it if

you can think of other ways of showing

you good at self management then don't

do these things that's not one so the

marking let's just go down to that he's

her just different ways you can talk

about all the different things I'll talk

about what's deliverable for this now

let me say now if I get to the marking

so for the something awesome all you got

to do is your video you make the little

two-minute video demonstrating what your

project was and your hand in a poster

which is one-page a for summarizing what

you've done you can put appendices on as

well

you submit them to your tutor and that's

do first I think that's do something

also must do the day before the tutorial

that's what we agreed on now before the

first you'd people at later tutorial

yeah that's the Tuesday next week write

those tutorials Wednesday yes yeah so do

Tuesday next week wait everyone's do

Tuesday next week yeah I think that

makes it more fair the tutors might have

a little bit of leeway but yeah it

should be everybody in the cohort do at

the same time so that'd be Tuesday next

week with respect if you've told us

differently and I seem to recall that we

were told differently that's a little

bit not great so who told you that and

what were you told

I was I was under the impression and I

may be wrong about this but I remember

being told it was due before your

tutorial in which case that would be

unusual because we had a tutor meeting

about it at the start of the term before

maybe I maybe I'm remembering wrong yes

that's I don't have it in writing so I

think that's how it was last year and we

were all very unhappy with it last year

so we decided this year it would be the

day before

was that we would present it in the

tutorial is that not the case yeah but

you you sorry Chris you I was just gonna

so there's not gonna be enough time in

one tutorial to go through all the stuff

that we need to in terms of course

content and the case study and people's

presentations so they'll probably

overlap two weeks but we don't want

somebody who goes in the second week to

get a week extra and somebody who goes

in the first so everything needs to be

true before people start presenting yeah

so just make a little video yeah you

don't want to do a live presentation or

you'll just have all sorts of nightmares

do a live presentation just record it

yourself like doesn't have to be so what

presenting in the truth is just our

pre-recorded video yeah we'll talk to

you tutor they might be happy for you to

also do a different thing if you want

but I'm thinking people just do their

pre-recorded video what do you think the

pre-recorded videos all we need if

anyone wanted to do a different thing we

could do that as well um I'll have a

chat to locky and get some clarification

and there'll be an announcement made

tomorrow but yeah if you choose us happy

for you to do other things well that's

fine but the video and the report I

think I'm just thinking about it myself

now Chris I don't mind if people don't

want to if people want to present

something in the chewed itself I'm happy

with that because that's a bit more

interesting oh it's almost I've handed

in the video through the day but you

know and the due date yes Eve that's how

he did it last year we had people

handing in a video and that way you

basically got the option to make

something pre-recorded or yeah so

something was a pre-recording a bit more

structured and you could think about

your content or if it was just something

like a hardware demo you could do it in

person live that way when people ask

questions you can bounce it off and show

your understanding a bit more and what

you could in a pre-recorded video I

gotta say I like that more because

for me the best thing about something

also is it's just this beautiful time

and up and just show all the things I

know the last week you come out of it

and most people part it is a really

moving time so I'd be very happy to have

people talking and asking questions

it's just prepare fairness of marking

[Music]

don't think that's how long I can't

remember how long their work with a two

or three minutes so yeah just something

just to clarify we're handing in a

two-minute video and a one-page report

as they're something awesome and then

what if there's something awesome is not

like a one-page report sort of thing

what if it's like a book for example

awesome so yeah you can link to the

actual thing that's absolutely fine and

we will read it with joy and delight but

make a one-page summary like opposed to

the presentations of people know what

it's about and then people can then

click through from these from that to

whatever you want to show and when they

have to make a video if we want to

present in the like in lives something

you could just it could just be you have

it's both fairness I do think it's

important that everyone hand something

in at the same time because some people

won't be presenting for another week and

that's just the way that I see it is

that the video is the thing that you

should be submitting and then because

it's only three minutes long a lot of

people can't get all their content in in

three minutes so in a presentation in

your tutorial you sort of just say these

are the cool things here's the video

that I've got watch it later but if

anybody's got any questions related to

my project it can show you it will

demonstrate your understanding better if

you're able to answer questions that

people have got so you sort of spend two

or three minutes

walking in the tutorial about the stuffy

youth you've done over the term to show

that you understand what you're talking

about and you haven't gone and ripped

the CTF solutions off some online and

then done a video on those solutions

yeah and here's a crazy thing and this

is just

but flowing about the Sigma pens I

wouldn't mind if the people that

presented in the first week didn't do

the video and just the people at

presenting the second week do you think

of that Christian you can choose where

they want to go in first or second week

I don't want to make any decisions right

now in the lecture it might be cutting

it a bit fine what do you think of the

idea that if you wanted if you're in the

first week because you're going to some

we'll be presenting it first and some

will be presenting in a second during

the first week you can just present know

somebody might go wrong when you present

I think you say Laura I think you're

safer if you make a video and then do a

presentation that the presentation works

just pay attention to that not the video

if it works but if it doesn't work we've

got the video you happy with that okay

yeah yeah it's just a bit surprised

because I didn't realize we were like

restricted to a certain type of

formatting oh no do whatever you wanted

the video I just mean like a video you

know oh do other things if you want to

no no sorry the video is just a summary

of the project is not the project the

project is the project everyone's gonna

look at it and we're gonna watch it and

if it's a book or a poem or a movie or a

website or a war game or whatever it is

that's the project it's just we have to

have some sort of artifact that everyone

gets to say that's all oh and now we're

all separate to each other I think the

video is is pretty essential because

otherwise how can people see what you've

done we have to show it to them

correct if I'm wrong but I don't think

the video needs to be like a high

quality professional car no nothing you

can just be like a pop into the meeting

talk about your projects for two minutes

and then like while you're recording

that's exactly right urban that's right

could just be a zoom meeting that you

just record of you presenting a stuff

and maybe you can get one of your

friends to watch while you do it and

clapping cheer or your parents yeah sure

yeah have you won have you won but do

put your face up somewhere or smile or

something just so people know it's you

but yeah do whatever you want you've got

two to three minutes to do a piece of

communication to demonstrate you know

what you did for the something awesome

and we no one's looking at it sort of

crossly or strictly or trying to market

mainly if one's looking at it just

rejoicing what you've done and really

proud of you it's this really happy time

yeah yeah look if you're too shy to put

your face on don't but if I son yep

whatever works for you is fine by me

absolutely um let me get to the marking

because I reckon it runs quite stress so

let me show you how we might get in

there Mike relax your two minute public

domain video are you putting in the

public domain so we can actually take

[Music]

all right how we exist how we assist

them right each one of the sections so

there's those five sections and

something or since one of the sections

is assigned to a category is given a

mark either satisfactory who well that's

clearly met the objectives is of course

well done I'm expecting no one is going

to get less than satisfactory I would be

astonished then the next one is amazing

includes nearly all the stuff we want to

see and it's got strong evidence whoa

hope we get amazing and then there's an

eleven you can get eleven out of ten if

it's just so amazing that your tutor is

struck down and turns to stone because

it's the most incredible thing anyone's

ever seen so they're the marks you can

get and then not so nice victory so

basically I'm for a satisfactory you if

you put work into it there's almost no

way you can't get a satisfactory and

then amazing if what you've done is

quite amazing and eleven well we

sometimes get two or three lemons okay

so that's quite can you see it's not

strict marking it's not scary it's just

a chance for you to show off and notice

that students from previous years have

reported that when you go for a job

interview an actual real one you tend to

spend quite a lot of your time talking

about the things that you put in this

portfolio so we're this is a dry run for

when you're going for your first job

interview because you are now starting

to work out who you are what your

strengths are and the things you've done

is evidence to support that and you're

practicing putting that in so I just

want you to view this as an exercise to

practice your ability to showcase

yourself and what you've done and at the

same time maybe yourself reflect on what

you've done and feel good about it is

not a scary sort of marquee type

exercise

are there any questions about this

something awesome let's go Andrew first

and then keep going if we did something

else challenge based so like a CTO for

similar how would we go about doing a

video demonstrating what our project was

how did you do a CDF I know I did

something also similar I didn't hack the

box challenges okay you did all hey so

yes so just produce some artifacts from

it so have you done reflective blog

entries as you've gone is there some way

you've helped other people you've done

write-ups or what have you what have you

physically done oh yeah like I've done

some stuff like like I wouldn't make a

video about how I did ride ups no no but

the write-ups could help you with the

video so you could just took him the

video since you told him the camera jump

in a zoom room and say hi my name is

Andrew I started this course really

wanting to learn low-level hacking and

so I found hack the box and I decided

for my something or someone was going to

do as many of the challenges in it as I

wanted as I could so I've been working

on over the semester I've done now 27

other challenges

I reckon I've put 600 hours into it I

was it really a bit stupid and probably

all my other marks have suffered Fred

thank heavens for the virus and um and

it's been an incredible experience what

have I learned

okay here are the three main things I've

learned blah blah blah blah what would I

suggest to someone else wanting to do

this although I reckon you should start

if I was doing it again how would I do

it differently what's the thing I'm most

proud of

ah this challenge here it was really

hard I nearly gave up about 17 times and

then I saw something on an ad for the

public service Department of Finance it

suddenly gave me an insight into how to

solve polio banana bread I jumped around

the house shouting here's a picture of

me going Eureka Eureka I didn't take a

photo of the time so this is a

reenactment of it and I was so happy and

I got it out and I'm this is what I'm

gonna do in the future I'm always want

to do this now and I would really

encourage anyone that's themselves

interested in learning how to do

lo-lo-love I came to try hack the box

and I guess what I'm gonna do now in my

moving forward is I'm gonna write some

of these myself I just now I'm so

obsessed with CDF said I think I'd like

to write some TC TS maybe that'll even

be my honours project

there you go there to be a great

presentation what do you think of that

okay that's pretty good it gives me

something to work with yes and if you

can't think of ideas ask you to to how

you can present it cuz they are

excellent or just someone else that you

know or someone else in the course

basically we just need to know what was

impressive about what you did so it was

a personal challenge it was meeting the

goal you always wanted to have or

something you a little bit scared about

was something took a lot of effort

something you had to be persistent for

it was something that involved you're

changing your character in some way you

have to be more organized more this or

that whatever about it that really

impressed you that you really like tell

us it's your ability to show off why

what you did was fantastic so I just say

I did this this and this tell us why

that's meaningful to you and why are you

sort of proud of it and then show your

analytical skills by talking about the

things you wish you'd done better and

things if you could do it again and I

always like including advice for other

people just saying for people that are

watching this video who themselves are

going to do is something else um next

year my strong tips are blah blah blah

that's helping other people so yeah keep

going there was more questions unless

Andrew you had anything else thanks come

we had yes you had a question about the

comment in the next section how strongly

should I be focusing on this 8 minutes

is that a pretty hard fast eight minutes

it reads as if it is yeah but to

actually articulate a whole something

awesome in eight minutes full and the

rest of it in eight minutes is probably

going to be a struggle for some it's

hard so what you have to do is uh for

each of the sections the mark is going

to spend eight minutes reading it so Oh

per section I just must have missed that

so what they'll do is they'll open it up

so that's about a page it could be two

pages if they're fast breeders and

there's not much clicking for them to do

so I'd try and keep it at a page it's a

page where you put your most important

things so you've probably done 50 things

but you're in a job interview if you

tell them fifty things are gonna fall

asleep don't think of it as a job

interview think of it as you're going on

a date it's a first date and if this

goes well you guys might have a

relationship so what

you're gonna bore them with long lists

of stuff no they say tell me about

yourself you go I'm glad you asked

he's 17 things about me instead you're

gonna say well what's the one or two

most important things about me to say

and then you're gonna say the most

important one first and the second most

important one second and then you give

some funny examples or powerful or

compelling examples so they believe it

you like just saying it you can't just

say tell me about me tell me about you

oh well I'm really kind I'm a really

kind person it's not convincing say I

think kindness is really important and I

volunteer for some vincent depaul doing

this every week and I do this and that

yeah no that's that's that's I marry you

so that's what we're looking for here

hurricane in eight minutes you can do a

summary of one or two key things and

they just have links to the rest and

they'll click through on links I mean

don't even have them reading the whole

eight minutes there they're probably

Chris will talk about this more but

they'd like to skim read what you've

written in about four minutes and then

spend the remaining four minutes

clicking on links and investigating so

they go he said his time manager was

really good you did everything on time I

don't really believe that I'm jealous

gonna start checking some of these

activities because give me links to all

the activities he's done I'm just gonna

double-check that and they'll click

through or he said he did this and he

noticed this amazing thing into

something awesome I missed I missed that

before I'm gonna go and find out more

about that because that sounds really

interesting

you remember sorry I don't want to cut

you off Richard but some we did speak

earlier today about that you've got

seven seconds to make a first impression

so all of your tutors know you now but

we don't know the quality of work that

you're going to put in for a final

assessment so that sort of when we open

the page you've got seven seconds to

really impress us and see you know this

is the amazing work that people have

done and then when I've got that sort of

feel for where things are going to be

going then I'll dive deep into the

evidence and make sure that that first

impression is accurate that's right

that's right

that's very good thanks guys more

questions Vidya did you have a question

no no I just thought you were putting

your hand up and write a summary about

the project in the report yeah so this

so there's the normal four criteria and

then the fifth criteria is is something

awesome what the normal for all sort of

treated the same your hand in a one or

two page thing for each of those in

there Bank Minister market there's

something awesome is the only thing

that's a little bit different that's got

a one-page poster that summarizes the

whole thing and it's also got a video

and the reason we do that is because we

want you to present your something

awesome we don't want them just handed

in and not seen by anyone we want you to

stand up and tell the world what you've

done the world being your tutorial class

and everyone in your class get to hear

what you've done your tutor get to hear

what you've done so it's a chance to

talk about insurance and that's why

there's this sort of visual presentation

side to it and then the reason for the

video is just because we've now got so

many students that will be spreading it

over time and it's just not fair to give

someone an extra week I think it does

that make sense one are there any more

questions I have a feeling there was a

question at the beginning

um I have a quick question so with

something awesome I'm assuming it's not

just about um like selling your like

good strength so it's also about selling

you know your personality as well to

sort of get employers to see if you're a

good fit or not as well as being good or

not right no I see where you're going I

think that would be unfair to do that I

think we just want to know that you've

done something awesome and it's not your

personality at all in fact really we

don't I know when I've employed people

in companies personality is not

important you do want a good fit so you

want values that are the same but I've

worked with shy people and extroverted

people extroverted people and outgoing

people and inarticulate people and there

are all really wonderful people so yes

not about personality it's not about

show it's not about pizzazz

I mean it's about showing the sense that

you got to communicate some ideas so put

some thought into it don't just turn up

blogging along and not really having

planned it I mean planet and work out a

good piece of communication you only got

three minutes but but ya know it's not

about your personality at all the only

thing comes close to personality being

assists is in the security attitude in

your security mindset we do want to

check that your analytical and we do

want to check that you're constantly

reflecting on things and analyzing

things but even if that's not normally

in your personality you can still do it

for this course you know in the sense

that even more impressive

okay Jenna uh yeah I'm guessing it might

be a little harsh in the real world oh

maybe not I don't know you're only

getting but basically the question in

front of everyone when you're talking is

this amazing or is this you know clear

satisfactory I'm pretty evident within

seconds whether it is or not you

yourself would know oh well I actually

know about your project it it actually

probably is amazing so yeah it just

makes your people realize how amazing it

is what you did okay yeah but I'm not

marking you now in the lecture in front

of everyone you can't be cross if it's

but but it has injured to be amazing

what what Chandler's done is he's fooled

around with rootkits it's tried to teach

himself route kids and the thing that's

really impressive isn't the actual route

kid stuff it's the process of trying to

write a rootkit

and the things you need to understand to

write it and then the things you need to

deal with it when you're trying to test

them quite vast and huge and require

this enormous patience and perseverance

not to give up and that is actually

really impressive so if your

presentation demonstrates that you've

done that sort of thing then that's

really good and no one will care about

as Nulty or what clothes you're wearing

or anything I will take this opportunity

to say I crash the computer by opening

the main pages

well sometimes attackers don't want the

victims to read the main pages sorry

what's a main page

I'm a programmer well a man page for

those that aren't computer nerds is it's

almost as bad as an acronym

it's a jargon it's a shortening of

manual because computer scientists when

they were programmers in the old days

every letter meant you have to punch

something else on a punch card so you

were stingy and you did make your

program short and so everything was

given really short names and manual as

in the instruction manual that's way too

long for anyone to have a type on a card

so we just called it man

I don't know why we can just call it him

[Music]

yes we still do that noe it's very sad

we should call it manual yep so when you

try to read the manual the computer

exploded and that is very impressive hmm

more questions because I did have a

sense that someone was asking a question

at the same time Andrew did at the very

beginning and they backed off did they

when I come back now I think I might

have been maybe I already asked my

question thank you everyone

well if there's no more questions I've

got a fun little puzzle for you on our

remaining four minutes oh I have a

question about communication so just

then we use some jargon or like an

abbreviation of men but like I almost

felt that for people who understand what

that is you kind of lose your audience

while you explain things yes so although

you say don't use abbreviations and you

know don't use all this technical jargon

because it excludes people in the same

way taking the time to explain

everything when you have people who do

understand is almost losing your

audience and they might feel a bit like

you're being a bit condescending or

something even not that you were to

spend but like I feel in especially in

research settings that could be the case

yeah it's really hard I mean the

question is know your audience and say

what you have to say for your audience

and then so what you're really talking

about there Lauren is sorry Laura is the

the problem of diversity

if you quite if you've got a diverse

audience and the problem of diversities

are nightmare and Tom will know all

about this from first year that's our

biggest diversity problem we've got

people coming in who can program and in

programming our lives and people who

come program at all and we don't want to

separate them into different strains

because that's not fair because after a

course or two they'll all be

intermingled and if we separate them

into different streams they might feel

that they're not as good and the people

that start behind might feel that that's

where they belong you know red eye brown

eye blue eye sort of thing so um so yeah

diversity is a real problem with an

audience so how I always try and deal

with it is I try if I'm going to explain

something that people probably already

know but I do want to explain explain do

know there are several people in here

who don't know that I try and make it a

bit funny so at least you get some value

from me explaining it and maybe I can

make one or two other

interesting points so maybe you got a

chance to think about why we had short

names or notice that we have this

propensity to abbreviate things and you

know maybe there was a little bit of

interest in there but yeah I call that

dog whistling which now unfortunately

has horrible political terms which is in

every piece of communication I try and

put things in for as much of the

different diversity is I have in the

room I'll try and put things in will

interest those particular people but to

the other people hopefully it's not too

boring sand they don't notice some sort

of sort of turns out so if we were

explaining something I might in the

words I do or a couple of throwaway

remarks I put in I might put things in

there that if you're already really on

top of this it's still really

interesting because you've got some new

way of thinking or some interesting

puzzle to go and follow but I'll do it

in such a way hopefully if I'm

successful that the people listening

that don't know anything are reassured

that I'm explaining it and they don't

notices this high level other thing

going on as well so yeah diversity is

hard either teach them separate things

but I like them all together or look

after one and bore the others that's

hard or try an entertaining run and

that's what good comedians and

entertainers do if you watch a comedian

structure a set they're trying to do it

so that they're appealing to everyone

and it's quite tricky to do that and

they have to appeal to their long-term

fans as well as new people that have

never heard this stuff before and yeah

it's a challenge I mean that's what

makes it fun that's why research is fun

it's not an easy thing

you're right Lauren Lauren RA and Tom

but then let me say this fun joke that I

do want to set the N so there's a really

great talk about C++ a language that I

know very little about but it's

basically talking about common bugs and

it's trying to communicate to people you

know the bugs that they might have in

their code and there's this point that

the speaker makes at the start basically

says there are two types of people in

this room the people who have not seen

these bugs before and the people who

have seen these bugs before who've seen

the 100 times and he's like you know you

haven't seen them before then you'll

learn something but if you have seen

them before the conversation we want to

have is how do we stop them and so

there's this really great they calling

me and how he's explaining it about like

he knows that there are two parallel

audiences and every time he's speaking

is trying to address both concerns so

it's something I try and do as well with

like you know I know there are people

who know a lot and who don't so trying

to talk about both things at once is

really you

cool I really like the way that he

flagged what he was doing that almost is

that's part of getting in the mind of

the people too so now people are perhaps

a bit more tolerant when he does it but

also his flag that there's something in

here for you because the worst thing

about being a smart person or a person

who's knowledgeable already is when

you're listening to something you make

up your mind pretty quickly if there's

anything in it for you and you can think

I'll switch off I won't get anything

from this and then you can miss all

sorts of wonderful things so I guess

that's flagging early on that even if

you're smart and I'm talking a bit in

the beginning and I'm losing your

attention because it's boring it's worth

sticking in there because there'll be

some fun puzzles for you later on that's

very clever so I like that and thank you

for sharing that and if you can share

the link to that I'm gonna go I can try

and find it Ezreal and I wasn't trying

to shut you up but I do appreciate that

you gave us this tiny little second at

the end so I want to just give you a

puzzle and I actually I've got three

puzzles but I'll do the really fast

puzzle number one I'm gonna toss a coin

and if it's heads I don't know maybe I

maybe there's two of us and we want to

make sure we want it there's two of us

we both want to present in week one not

in week two for the something awesome

and we have to decide who's gonna do it

so I say hey who's it who make the

tossing with maybe I'm going to toss

with Lucy can I toss with you yes so we

gonna you so I'm gonna just toss a coin

and heads I win tails you win okay and

now I toss the coin oh sorry you lost

what do you think of that protocol

it's a bit dodgy because I can't tell if

what the actual result was yes so ignore

the fact that I could have tossed it on

screen and we could have had a camera

doing it because then forging the result

is a little bit harder but you can see

it's still possible if you're a computer

and a darkened room and all you're

getting is bits coming in and someone

tells you those bits mean in the real

world the head was tossed then you're

just there's a trust thing here so my

challenge you challenge number one is

let's get the visual element out because

it's distracting because we sort of

think that can't trick us so let's just

suppose we're on the telephone

what's a protocol you and I could follow

so we toss a coin is a 50-50 chance

and we're both convinced at the end that

it was fair that's puzzle number one can

anyone to work out how to do a

distributed coin toss puzzle number two

I know a secret I don't know what is it

I know I know

[Music]

I know the ingredients for coca-cola and

your Pepsi and if you give me a million

dollars I'll tell you the ingredients

for coca-cola and you say no way you

could be ripping me off you tell me the

ingredients then I'll give you a million

dollars and I say what do I say okay I

trust you

here's the ingredients oh yeah thanks

saga and then I give me the money umm

that's tricky isn't it because I've got

a secret I want to sell but how can I

convince someone that I have the secret

without telling them the secret and when

I tell them the secret the secrets lost

its value as a secret so my question is

number two Tommy we're gonna say how can

do it yeah

CAF isn't here so I'm gonna have to say

it but if you put it on the blockchain

and everything just works yeah yeah so

we when we're not going to do that we're

going to imagine in all our answers we

can't say the word blockchain um big

thank you blockchain uses a lot of

cryptographic solutions to achieve an

overall effect and but I want you to

work out what the actual cryptographic

solution is that causes it and lo and

behold blockchain as part of its mixture

of stuff uses that but yeah yeah so the

smallest solution you can come up with

much less elaborate than blockchain but

yeah you're right blockchain would solve

this that lets you do a distributed coin

toss that lets us sell a secret let me

sell a secret to you but you pay me the

money we're both convinced I know the

secret but I don't have to tell you the

secret and my third puzzle I'll tell you

the third puzzle next week because we're

out of time so I'll see you all on wed

instead everyone

it was lovely talking to you and i hope

you're all well and stay good and we'll

have lots of fun on wednesday it's gonna

be a fun like okay see you all bye

prior to my return by returning to this

is nice I'm just gonna say he's saying

goodbye to run my Lewin Adrian hey Oh

 Laura Kristin and tiffy a nice in

heaven and who are you Adrian and Evie

and room Graz hey Richard Harry Caray

yes who's that talking uh Callen where

are you killin I don't have my webcam on

cuz I've got people behind me could you

put that list of books which he

recommended on the happy at home page

yes that's a great idea and if you need

a copy of one of them and you can't get

it I'll post it to you if you want some

books thank you will do come and thanks

for the lecture today I was a pleasure

and you share some good books back if

you've got any good ones I will settle

thank you alright see ya I hey John I

really like your name with all those

ages that's really cool that's really

funny I've not seen that one before that

is very good rare to see a new ID see ya

see ya bud see you Andrew you're both a

see iris

we've got Andrew iris iPad he's still

here carry iris Brendon Oh Brendon hey

thanks for doing the recording that was

fantastic you are a complete legend

thank you thank you does everyone know

Brendon recorded the lecture and saved a

copy so even when I lost the recording

he had one oh what a good man see ya ah

they are Renan hey oh man you made me

smile if you could have seen what you've

done thank you you got on recording

right now it's like um I've got it sort

of like it's like plugged in yeah and

that's doing the backup just in case

well what year are you in

I'm a part-time student so it's kind of

complicated like I'm sort of like like

I've been doing a very slow sort of half

rate so I've been at the Uni for about

four years but I'm sort of okay so you

still might have three or four years to

go yeah I think it's like a this year

and then next year I think I've got

added up when you go if you ever need a

reference make sure you get one from me

okay thank you and you should try out

for the Amazon project you know we run

this project where you go to Amazon and

your cloud security with them what's

that project though we run this project

well whenever we can and we're running

it at the moment we're proud to run a

next year where Amazon come and teach

cloud security to some of the students

and they actually go to work at Amazon

doing this or abide by Amazon but in the

Amazon offices and stuff and their

security team is so nice I don't think

they get to know you and you get to know

them and it leads to awesome jobs with a

really awesome team because I really

like those guys and their values so you

should definitely do it because you're a

sort of more mature student and you've

got this sort of I really like your

approach just doing things that's sort

of exactly what they're looking for so

try that project if you're interested

and it could we'll be a click between

you and them it sounds great and there's

someone here without a name who are you

as someone who's got an empty node

that's so clever what's the first letter

of your name hey you're not gonna kill

me oh that's so cool oh I know your name

it's unmute and who else have we got we

got Tom carry a badge it Ryan

Andrew jazz have been both a virus

alright oh and look hey hey how'd it go

tonight Lachlan was in all right yeah no

I had to step out for chunk in the

middle um yeah good

while you were stepped out Chris and I

reworked the marketing of the whole

a portfolio you'll believe you I believe

you throwing me under the bus like that

reach it that's a tomorrow problem

I really love having it was fantastic

having you in the lecture thanks a week

yes so grinning null time is very very

all right oh it's a B I didn't recognize

you with this glass is new well thanks

Ava you're doing a great job

I keep hearing good things about you see

ya is it pronounced abbaji oh yeah see

you bye good night to you all I'm

thinking I'm Laughlin's waving goodbye

I'm thinking I'm gonna go cuz I'm keen

to find out what the situation is with

my dad but is there anyone that wants to

just have a chat because I don't want to

go if this one we used to talk about

something I just wanted to quickly say

you should figure out how to do the

show/hide video / hainan video

participants thing yes because then you

get everyone's faces on the screen

alright I will

I'll practice with that thank you also

just set up the gallery view so if you

stop sharing your content Richard yes

and then on the you you can set up so

that you can see everybody's faces you

just need to select gallery view instead

of I stopped sharing was shared is it

yeah so up the top right it usually says

speak of you if you click speak of you

it'll switch it to gallery view and then

I will show you like section webcams

yeah I can see it is then you just

right-click one of them right click one

of them and there we go chat pin video

pin video and do i do pin video on first

screen no i the one underneath in video

should be hide

and now I've got pin video on second

screen spotlight video make host make

co-hosts allow record remove rename put

on home so if you click on somebody

doesn't have their way I'm active like

carry down the bottom re carrying you

and then hide non bid dear participants

should be on that oh yeah it is down the

bottom I'm just gonna briefly carry but

I'll Becky's oh yeah that's cool I can

see it wrong with cameras on and I just

double check it's not affecting your

view it's just no no testing I've got a

big screen up now so I can see as many

faces as possible it might be on the

recording but oh and it's the way I

really like the picture right is there

anyone else thanks Evan that was useful

does anyone else need to talk to me or

anything they want to say I had one

question speaking of the recording does

Lisa have access to downloaded

yeah she should got wasn't thanks I'll

talk to her about some stuff

Thanks so I think Richard UI and Lisa

have a phone call tomorrow I think was

she talking to you about that oh good

yeah sure she communicates that to me is

she'll have stuck it in my calendar okay

no worse like a buffer overflow I just

have no drama so it's just making sure

that we were all in on the same page

Cokely all right I'm off I'll catch up

yeah I mean see a llama

you

hello hey hi everyone

you

you

you

you

you

hello can you hear me

I reach it I can hear you Oh wonderful

fantastic thank you hi

I'm just slowly letting in prana that's

wonderful look at all those baby ball is

that Tom there yep hey Tom are you able

how can i is there an easy way of doing

this Twitter okay Chandler idea that

maybe some people could unmute their

mics I know that's crazy because

everyone always says mute your mics but

actually it'd be nicer if I could hear a

little bit of noise

oh yeah that's fantastic thank you oh

thanks thanks everyone who's doing that

that's really good if it's really noisy

where you are just mute it again a bit

it's sounding good hey Ryan hey Sarah

hello ah ah maybe um

okay run so wave at me if you'd like to

start turn on your camera if you

possibly can be that would be think

that's good please I this idea that even

if you don't want to turn off I don't um

even if you don't want to turn your

camera on hopefully don't mind doing

that if you could just take a photo of

yourself with your phone or something ha

ha oh yeah

and mail it to us posted on the the

announcement page for this just post a

photo of you sitting there I think at

least that'll be really nice so anyone

that hasn't got that camera on if you

wouldn't mind I believe we'll get okay

that's fantastic I can hear a cat Wow

we never get that one we're at uni do we

already with so much better

oh hi everyone welcome to trial number

two I'm just looking at the other screen

right over there wanna see if everything

seems and the main thing I wanted to

share one is where I'm wearing my

favorite t-shirt a Winchester t-shirt

with just a tavern t-shirt it's so good

so because I think it's sort of fitting

at the moment because as everyone knows

the Winchester tavern is where you need

to go things go bad so I reckon I mean

the Winchester so let's go to the notes

I'm gonna try and share my screen let's

see if that works

I should have set the notes up if I've

done it right so you can follow along

twos I shouldn't have any protection on

them we go five notes somehow I've

pulled it off this time I can see

everyone's faces and I can also see the

lecture notes that's really good two

screens going all right and so I'm going

to the slides for today which is the

module five slides which you find by

going to the schedule on the side and

then clicking on the slide for quick

five I give it hey have you shaved your

beard

I couldn't hear but I think that's

because so I could wear a face mask you

can wear a face yeah I heard lots of

people were doing yes and my friends who

are doctors are doing that too

so without any further ado oh let me

just say so with a hand-tied bid whether

adieu

let me just say the context of where we

are so we're in quiet week this week so

there weren't going to be any lectures

this week so this is just because last

week I didn't in all our experimenting

around I didn't get to cover all the

stuff but I've got this working right

it's being recorded and maybe one or two

of you a screen recording it as well in

case I stuff up and I'll post that

afterwards so people don't have to watch

it but the idea is we're going to finish

all the stuff that we didn't finish and

we're also just going to talk and smile

and see each other because I'm sort of

missing or seeing any humans but you

guys in particular it's quite weird just

being at home so it's very nice to see

everyone at the end of this we're going

to watch some movie anyone that wants to

and I've installed Netflix party and it

seems to work and the movie we're going

to watch is Eternal Sunshine of the

spotless mind for reasons it may or may

not be clear I think to some of you

probably work it out already why and

we'll talk about that after the film to

briefly we have a chance so I hope you

guys can hang around anyone just can you

show me a thumbs up if you're thinking

of hanging around or watching it

fantastic all right that's really good

excellent excellent

so that should be fun I went through a

list of about 50 films that we could

watch and Netflix are Hasley really rien

Netflix has relatively few of them so

I'm going to try and work out ways we

can watch films on other meetings too

because there's lots of fantastic

relevant security films but not many on

Netflix okay so let's get going now this

is actually one of my favorite topics

it's really important and in fact it's

so important that I moved it into week

five so we do it ahead of the break even

though it displaced privacy which is

incredibly important which will do just

after week so next week we'll do privacy

so I just thought this was so important

in terms of understanding security and

giving you a good mindset of security so

I move the topic early and the topic is

command and control now that's a

military phrase and it's got to do with

I mean it's used in lots of different

contexts

but I've mainly come across it in a

military context where it's about how

the actual flow of a guess of authority

and control to make the whole

organization or we could think of it as

an organism do something how is that

message transmitted all the way down and

who has power to do what and things like

that that whole network of power and

control we're going to call command and

control and the different patterns the

different ways that can happen actually

turn out to be relevant to sight well in

fact lots of areas of security too

because you'll often have something you

want to implement you'll have a policy

you want people to follow or effect you

want to achieve and you have this grand

idea at the top but it has to implement

Trickle all the way down to all the

people and things

how does that actually all work so it's

really fun and we're going to illustrate

command and control by looking at

nuclear accidents because they're

fascinating so I just want to start

talking about the Cold War now I think I

mentioned those for those of you that

saw dr. Strangelove a couple of weeks

ago in the old days whenever we started

talking about the Cold War I had to

really explain it because it was only an

idea to most people your age who'd grown

up in just peace and love and all that

awesome stuff since history stopped but

in the last few years it's become

increasingly less necessary for me to

explain the Cold War because we're sort

of entering into Cold War part 2 2.0 now

such is now part of our life and so it's

quite interesting how can we be reliving

that terrible mistake you know there's

that quite about those that don't learn

from history are doomed to repeat

history I think leaders and probably our

populations have influent from history

and might not know fully the history of

so anyway nuclear I just want you to

think of it so the rise of nuclear power

sort of maps the rise of the Cold War in

there it was introduced at the end of

the Second World War

that's sort of what ended the second

marked the end of the Pacific campaign

campaign against Japan from the America

England and um was the dropping of the

bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and then

after that the war finished and we had

these two superpowers Russia and America

who hated and distrust and disliked each

other and everything they stood for so

there's a lot of animosity but also

they're very powerful I each had a lot

of land they sort of divvied up all the

spoils at the end of the Second World

War which is actually often what happens

after a while the victors get lots of

goodies and so they were wealthy they

had control over large areas huge

populations and they each had different

political ideologies and they each were

persuading their population that their

idea was right and the other one was bad

and wrong and so they were pitted

against each other but they didn't want

to fight so they just had this constant

bickering and spying and doing small

things and it was a cold now at this

time the thing that sort of kept it cold

probably was the fact that nuclear

weapons were around so or one of the

things so if we had a war everyone was

thinking both sides would have nuclear

weapons in this world wouldn't be like

the last one and so that could be

terrible for everyone so they didn't

want to have a war but they still wanted

to keep fighting my children are off

like this so so we had Cold War so let's

look at what happens when two people are

fighting I have unimaginably powerful

and deadly weapons at their disposal

that could destroy the whole planet many

times over the surface of it many times

over let's look at how that plays out so

first of all if you just want to think

about it from the script

what are the risks now the military saw

a risk that the other side can attack

him defeat them and the military wanted

to use nuclear weapons to assert their

superiority and dominance that makes

sense

but there is this second risk which is

that something goes wrong there's a

mistake or whatever and the weapons are

used and the terrible devastation

happens and it's sort of by accident

from not by intent so this is where we

get to command and control either if we

look at it from the American point of

view the American president says launch

the nuclear missiles and other they

launch or they don't and if they don't

answer a particular sort of error if

they do that's correct behaving of the

system but what if the president doesn't

say launch what are the two things that

could happen well they could launch or

they could not launch so you can see

they are a correct behavior and an error

well and those two errors talk monotype

to were viewed very differently by

people the military were more much more

concerned about weapons being they

wanted to assure that if the president

said launch they could be launched and

the president saying launch and they're

not launching that would be a disaster

for them whereas I guess a lot of

scientists are grown and a growing

number of people even philosophers like

Bertrand Russell started getting really

worried about well what if no one says

launch that something goes wrong and the

missiles do launch that would be

terrible so that would be an accident of

some sort and we saw one sort of

accident dr. Strangelove we're just a

crazy general and what decides to launch

them and there's other ones I guess

where terrorists could grab them and

launch them or the Russians could do a

trick and trick the u.s. into launching

them to give them a plausible reason to

fight back or the bomb could just a bomb

could just got by accident in a plane

and the Americans might don't they're

being attacked and they might fight back

at Russia or they could be doing a

testing run somewhere and it could act

something could ago you know you start

thinking of all the things that keep off

it's a little bit funny and the

president was going around Kennedy was

going around just sort of checking out I

guess the first one to say is trimming

in the end of the war my understanding

is and I'm not a historian that the Air

Force had control over the bottoms

because they developed them and I don't

even think he knew that the first bomb

was going to be launched or what it

meant or oshawa I think it was a Russian

it doesn't know Gaddafi I don't know if

he knew about the first one being

notional but I do know if you know about

the second one coming that he found out

about it like everyone else did it

wasn't angry and he said this is a

normal weapon

it shouldn't be launched without my

say-so and he insisted the president has

the command to launch the missile unless

the president says yes they can't be

launched and that began the whole

command-and-control thing this idea of

let's set these weapons up so they can't

be used without the president saying go

there's a long story a long sort of

rambling thing so I apologize but at the

end I promise it will all make sense so

Kennedy when he came to power send some

people around to check what was

happening at all the different places

where the US military had their nuclear

weapons was the Arsenal under control

was it safe it could have actually be

used without the president knowledge and

they discovered all sorts of things and

I might have mentioned one number four

at an airfield in Turkey is the famous

one the president's employee or whoever

was discovered there was a lone jet

sitting on the runway with nuclear

weapons on earth ready to go or nuclear

weapons in one of the domes and why it's

ready to go we're just nearby

the domes anyway where the weapons were

kept we just kept adjacent to the planes

because I had a certain short period of

time in which I had to be able to lon

and it was just one soldier guarding it

and he had a rifle like just a crappy

rifle I always imagined a bolt rifle

like not even like a super-duper

automatic or semi-automatic thing but

maybe I'm dreaming but I think that's my

that's my recollection of it and it was

some like nineteen year old guy oh god

Sargent pot a private Pyle I'm looking

after this plane and it was in the

middle of Turkey and and there may be

the ROM I had a four barbed wire around

it or something and the guys going oh my

god just thinking it would just take

like one person with a sniper rifle and

you could get a plane and nuclear

weapons and Turkey at that side time was

not a country that anyone felt confident

they could trust would act in alignment

with American interests they they had

their own interests as well so there was

a serious threat that they could lose

control over there asked them not so

notwithstanding bad

there were also all sorts of other

things that could go wrong and the book

that a lot of this is documented in is

absolutely fantastic called commander

control by Eric Schlosser

a most amazing book I've got a reference

to it at the very bottom and he goes

through he tells a bit of a story

follows one particular accident and a

base in Arkansas but but along the way

he talks about the accidents that

happened so the danger here is and

forget about the turkey malicious thing

that's the danger everyone likes

thinking about it one always likes to

think about the enemy as being the real

danger but we know from this course

usually the real danger or often the

real danger is insiders and inside as he

and understanding malicious people they

could just be incompetent people or

errors or mistakes and it turns out

there was a serious risk of the nuclear

weapons being used accidentally or going

off and this book documents lots of the

incidents now an incident where a

nuclear weapon is damaged dropped could

go off could lead to an explosion but it

wouldn't necessarily lead to a nuclear

war is called Broken Arrow and where the

accident happened

and it could lead to a nuclear war

that's called a nuke flash I think

something like that and then there's

another one too event spear

oh here we are since 1950 there been 32

nuclear weapon accidents nose broken

Arrow's an unexpected event involving

nuclear weapons that resolves an

accidental launching firing good named

after loss of the weapon six have been

lost and never recovered

excuse me you don't want to hear me

sneezing pee it's a completely safe

sneeze I'm going to say just allergic to

nuclear weapon accidents so what what

happened we've got here is consistently

these things were dropped and mistakes

will have any more time and some of them

are so dreadful when you've read the

book you go oh my god

oh my god you know just a small line

between a complete catastrophe and what

happened and the public never knows in

fact often they lied to the public

there's lots of documented things of how

an accident would happen and afterwards

it's it's safe to go to this water I go

swimming in it myself or it's safe to do

this of course it wasn't it was this

complete lie they were flying planes

loaded with nuclear weapons above

Greenland which is owned by Denmark and

they promised they'd never have live

nuclear weapons and the planes going

over Denmark Danish yes and they weren't

supposed to have nuclear weapons flying

over American airspace over American

cities just in case it was tanker

accident but they did and they dropped

all sorts of bombs and lost them and

just never confessed behind now because

I guess if you've got the particular

structure that we're starting to get to

which is everyone just has to obey the

people above you don't really want to

alarm the people below so you don't

necessarily tell them the truth because

you're viewing them as things you want

to manipulate to not manipulate any bad

way but you want to achieve some goal by

getting all the people in upon them to

do things so you tell them what they

need to know what will be helpful to

achieve that effect you're not really

regarding them as equals or people that

need to know what's going on so lots of

these accidents one reported anyway

read this book you'll find lots of

examples I've just mentioned too in the

notes you might want to look up one is

the I never had I pronounce this this is

the base in

brain named Thule I always call it but

it could be fool a fool I have heard

someone talk about it tonight when they

pronounce that I thought oh no I know

how to pronounce it

so read about that 1968 accident you

don't have to but I think you should

it's so interesting that was the US

that's excellent

Wow we're nearly does anyone got a puppy

did anyone get a puppy because of the

yes you did Michael did you get it

because of the virus I didn't consider

it good time to be home it's a brilliant

time it's a puppy there yeah can we say

gonna run see Michael is he coming on

your screen really jealous I tried to

persuade my oh wow is it a shade is it

is it a shame Michael yeah she her name

Stevie Stevie me yeah what sort of dog

is it at caboodle

okay moon oh we've got a cabbie we've

always had cabbie yeah yeah it's like a

cabbie but smart I understand well then

well hello Stevie it's lovely to welcome

you to the course we should all bring

dogs to the next lecture I think I tried

I'm saying I while you're getting a

Michael I tried to persuade my family

that we should get puppies to sit out

this whole period of being at home but

they don't know but I'm sure they'll

regret that because I would have been so

good the only problem is every time I

walk everyone's trying to cut a select

people are coming like approaching

coming near me and I'm like back off how

can you solve that problem

that's apologist yeah and I just kind of

walk away crystal cross the road you can

cough or something yeah sneeze on a

camera with some sort of mucousy thing

or something more vicious looking well

done thanks Michael and thanks for

leaving your mic on that was really nice

okay so read about the Twitter incident

and that's a very interesting one

massive amounts of the area were

contaminated because they lost

bomb now uh yeah I should say the

hydrogen bombs or a lot of the bombs

anyway often had plutonium in them and

the problem with plutonium it's good for

my bottom point of view but it's

incredible that's got a lot the reason

the half-life and if it turns into dust

and gets into your lungs it's deadly and

even tiny amounts of it blowing around

in the air are deadly so if something

goes wrong oh and of course her nuclear

weapons work

don't listen if you're an able spy from

another country the ones to become a

nuclear power

because I'm sure we're not allowed to

talk about this but here's the secret of

her nuclear weapons work there's a

couple of bits of material that if you

put them together everything will

explode and you have to put them

together really quickly so often how

they do that is they put conventional

explosives on the outside to try them to

they explode that and then they boom

drive into the middle and explode so if

you think about it your nuclear weapon

has all these radioactive blobs in and

ready to squish into the middle was a

whole lot of high explosive around them

to make them go in it's like there's so

many ways it could explode and if it

gets hot it might explode some of them

if you drop them or hit them in the

wrong spot with a hammer they could

explode so depending on what the dead

matter is so when you have accidents

with these woman's like none of them

ever went off we're lucky I don't I

don't know of a nuclear explosion that

went off when a bomb was dropped though

a lot of them nearly did as you're

farming to read the book but

often the explosive material went off

that drives them together and just

luckily didn't drug together and when

that happens you get plutonium

everywhere and that's that's just deadly

and so up in Greenland when they dropped

some of these bombs and there was a

terrible fire they're contaminated so

much Leonard had to dig up all this snow

and land and then like zillions and

zillions of tons of it and ship it all

to somewhere in store it safely so the

contamination problems the nightmare and

that's actually why we're a bit worried

about satellites and things that use

plutonium batteries if something goes

wrong on reentry or the thing explodes

or something bad happens then plutonium

everywhere and there have been there was

one I think was a Russian that

re-entered recently or a while ago that

had other you know you're not in

clifford you know the details of this I

can't hear you Mike but we hey hey so

and in fact I even think there was a

wasn't there a plutonium battery left at

the top of Mount Everest or something

and then now it's been lost no one knows

this that's just this stuff that's

horrible that has this huge

environmental impact for ages so

plutonium very bad to you so accidents

and disasters for all sorts of things so

read about the truly accident the

Russian at one that happened just last

year you're probably were reading there

I know I was excessively what was

happening Russia was very coy about what

was going on and there was all this

stuff in the press about this and then

Trump's other tweeting only confuse

things more but it looked like it was a

nuclear test missile test went wrong and

it looked like there probably was well

there certainly was radioactive spill

and waste because I picked it up in

Norway they could detect the increase in

background radiation and this is part of

that every contact leaves a trace

whenever you do anything it often just

leaves a trace so that's how we enforce

nuclear test ban treaty is because they

created seismic things that you can pick

up with seismic waves for the earth and

when bombs go off they leave a little

signature of radioactive particles that

you can pick up in the distance

Shinobu the russians could say what they

want about Chernobyl but we were with

the wind was blowing towards Europe and

we were measuring the radiation so

that's another example of a side way a

side channel but they're just everywhere

these side channels um and yeah you

might want to read about the rationing

explosion that's interesting what we do

know about and what we've done but it's

just clear that we have these terrible

weapons that could cause terrible

destruction and all these accidents just

demonstrated over and over again not

really looking after them so we've just

been lucky and we've talked about lack

and risk before we've just been lucky we

haven't had a serious nuclear explosion

or worse and of course the real

dangerous if these things happen and

people don't understand quickly enough

why they happen like if America dropped

a bomb on itself or something like that

which has happened several times and it

doesn't blow up and actually goes off

it's possible that they could think a

Russian did it in retaliate against

Russia or China that's one and you might

say no that would never happen when

people are flustered and stressed they

never blame other people for what's

going wrong and of course we just have

that happening yesterday when like all

those people went to sent a link in the

website when remember someone posted a

line up and learning the first thing the

minister said is a cyber attack the site

went down because it was cyber attack

and my only comment to that was yeah and

a dog ate my lunch because a dog ate my

homework because it's just such an

obvious plausible excuse and then two

hours later he had to come back and say

ah actually I was wrong it's just our

site was crap and we hadn't built it

properly and thought about this thing

happening that's why I went wrong it

wasn't someone else's fault but of

course after you've launched a nuclear

strike two hours later you can't say ah

sorry yeah actually it wasn't really a

nuclear strike Oh Lauren what do you do

for you outside really or is that oh

yeah I'm so jealous

what are you what state are you in north

or south what state yeah New South Wales

I mean north and south

oh very bad I was sick yeah who else is

jealous yeah but Gloria you're in the

country I can say nice a background

picture oh damn trick me okay am i

pronouncing right is it Gloria I'm

saying it like the girl's name yeah it's

my girlfriend she's here no but she

don't you mean okay but we all know

about you because your name is here

hello no so what's your name oh yeah yes

say slowly be honest be honest yeah yes

hello Yanis um okay so you might want to

read about that and then I said

something about toilets just because if

we talk about side channels and every

contact leaves a trace a famous some

famous research on drug use in prisons

years ago they did all sorts of things

to work out if people were taking drugs

or not they asked then they measured

they did sampling and things but it

turned out the most accurate measure

they could do was to just examine the

sewage and look for traces of chemical

in there because you can't hide that and

they found large amounts of illicit

materials were being consumed inside the

jail

and in the 80s and 90s when cocaine was

everywhere and they used to do analysis

just on random banknotes because people

used to put the cocaine on the banknotes

I'm not exactly sure of all the details

but involved banknotes and powder and

that means that microscopic traces were

left and at some point I think there was

an estimate that half of the banknotes

in America had cocaine traces on them or

something so there you can't help but

leave little side channels going on

there I've often thought that if you

wanted to know where someone was if a

building was being used or it looks

empty was actually empty all you do is

you go along one day and look at the

water meter and then you'd go a month

later and look at the water meter again

and you can see because there's a meter

on the outside the building you see how

much water's bank it's you I bet the

people hiding in there

trying to make it like a zero or

something trying to make it look like no

one's in there wouldn't think to bypass

the water meter so anyway there's always

side channels and broken Arrow's are

interesting read about them

the this the cruise missile story is

really interesting too they loaded some

test missiles on a plane for testing run

by the accident and put live nuclear

warheads in them that happened quite a

few times and then no one knew that it

was important so they were unloaded and

left somewhere and he's just in a

storeroom were sitting six live nuclear

thermal nuclear hydrogen bomb with no

one guarding them just sitting there and

then so anyway the moral of this whole

story is that there is this terrible

risk that you don't look after things

yourself and it's very hard and and

often your biggest danger is looking

after things yourself so now we get back

to commanding control and the thing was

the president wanted to make sure that

only the president can launch so how can

the president enforce that when all the

people under them are doing stupid

things all these mistakes are happening

people are dropping things accidents

happen all the time how can you actually

enforce your power all the way down it's

very hard and that's what we're there's

the book and there's another book

they're both really good weapons safety

yeah there's a lot about weapons safety

in these books and also there's a couple

of really good shows and podcasts about

a nuclear weapon safety you might want

to find out but basically the people

making the bombs in the old days made

them so they'd explode and an error was

you drop the bomb and it doesn't explode

so they went for a lot of effort to make

sure that when you drop the bomb it did

explode and it wasn't for quite a while

till people started asking the question

noticing that all these accidents were

happening and the accidents weren't even

being logged or documented for a while

it was really even fine too hard to find

out everyone was just saying yeah no I

didn't everything's fine but when they

started investigating looking down they

found all OH

hope let me just take one funny accident

they flipped the wiring accidentally on

one of the missiles on the switch that

goes between safe and armed so whenever

you set it to say if you're setting it

to armed and whenever you set at armed

you're setting it too safe and then sach

insisted that every time they fly they

used live missiles on the planes to do a

proper test but they always set them to

disarm but this plane was flying around

with live missiles

and now honey with you and they can go

for a whole range of things including

heights they can be height sensitive

impact sensitive so I mean obviously

there's more mechanics before they golf

but it's just very dangerous to have

them to the extent that if you on the

ground just dropped it or bump did it

might go off if it's armed so so these

mistakes happen all time so after a

while some people start saying these

missiles need to be made safe these

weapons we've got need to be made safe

against us we need to make sure they

don't go off we need to make sure

mistakes don't happen or if mistakes do

happen it's not a disaster so they came

up with this idea of one point safe and

one point safe was if how essentially

how how the question they're interested

in is what does it take to make it go

off so if it got shot with a rifle

bullet

wouldn't go off if we've got if it's if

there was possible just to find one

point on the bottom there where if you

impacted that point the bomb would go

off then that would be dangerous and if

you could build the bomb so there's not

one single point on it that will make it

go off so you'd have to do it with two

bullets or drop it twice or drop it into

a point that was one point safe so it

was safe against just one point piggy so

now you see this this idea we're going

to come up we're going to keep starting

to come up to a whole lot of times it's

basically the idea of failsafe that when

something goes wrong it's not a

catastrophe you build it so it takes

more than one thing going wrong for the

thing to go off now the there were

different explosives they use to some of

the explosives couldn't be detonated in

a fire and some of the explosives could

be detonated in a fire so if you've got

those high explosive round the nuclear

things which one do you think you should

use the one that can or can't be dead

man in a fire given that the biggest

accident danger when you're flying

around in these flowing fuel tankers up

in the air is if one could just crash or

something can go off often on the runway

they would just burst into flames for

various reasons and accidents and people

had all be standing around nervously

hosing them knowing they're like nuclear

weapons on board at that time you're

really hoping there'd be use the

explosive that doesn't go off when it

gets hot you've used another explosive

but actually the army they learn the Air

Force guys kept using the wrong one

because it was cheaper and more reliable

and they're tested of course for safe

and it was very hard for anyone to make

anyone concerned about safety no one

wanted to talk about it and I think this

is part of human nature thing that when

we focus on a problem we can focus on

that to the extent of all others and we

come a bit blind to the others

so everyone was so paranoid about the

Russians and the Cold War and if I'm so

determined that their weapons would work

and so on that no one was thinking about

the other risks and almost if you stood

up and said I think we should make these

bombs a bit safer so they're a bit hard

to go off

and that would mean of course as we all

know that sometimes that won't go off

when you want them to go off you know

just that's consequence of fixing one

area you increase the other um even if

you spend a lot of money and then people

would look at you go don't be crazy we

can't make these bumps and they don't go

off what if we what if the whole

American future life depends on it going

off it's the only one being dropped at a

critical spot you know we didn't go off

because they stupid namby-pamby thing

you put on so I I now want to talk about

the corona virus so with the corona

virus we've got the same thing I think

we were obsessing and thinking about it

as much as anyone ever did about the

Cold War and that's a good thing because

now we've got a lot of collective minds

thinking about it and all sorts of good

thinking's going on and will come out

good solutions but there's also that

time danger we had in the Cold War that

if we just think about that to the

extent of all others it's the big

exciting attention-grabbing thing at the

moment then we'll start to neglect other

things so it's quite possible like after

9/11 happened a whole lot of bad

legislation was brought in in America

because no one wanted to talk about

tight or as everyone was just saying

let's get the law fixed up so we can

attack these terrorists and stop

terrorists in the future but at the same

time a whole lot of other bad things

going through the Lord because no one's

worried about those are bad things and

if you make your nuclear weapons so they

do go off all the time when you want

them to that's good but then bad things

can happen like they're more dangerous

just sitting around and that's something

no one notices so I think that's

probably our biggest risk with Corona at

the moment is that bad things other

things going to happen because we've got

our attention off them and I think I

talked about that before when I was

talking about Bush and how they did a

pandemic simulation online when he was

president he became so obsessed with I

think smallpox they did quite a good

thing in making America safe against the

smallpox attack but a lot of other

things got neglected at the same time so

we do have to be careful with it so

anyway that's what happened with weapon

safety no one wanted to know about it

the one person that eventually did write

up the military code train of command

officially reporting it because no one

was interested

essentially it was a whistleblower he

was a bit blacklisted in his career when

a good bad

at the Avon pin-code I think someone's

already talked about that but one of the

things the president insisted is that

there be things called permissive action

links remember powers I can't remember

what it stood for I think it was

permissive action links and these were

they that basically insisted that

devices be put on the bomb that meant

the bomb couldn't go off without in

order from him so if you've got hold of

a bomb it's still no good you can't

launch it you can't or you can launch it

but it won't explode unless the

president starts something so that one

way they were trying to implement that

was putting pin codes on them and then

the president would release the pin code

just before the attack and then everyone

took the pin codes in now you can see

already now there's a danger of things

going wrong with this so maybe your

attack won't work because the phone line

goes down and can harm the bomb or

whatever but it did mean the president

could be sure that they wouldn't go off

with that he was right in pink but does

anyone know I'm pretty sure a couple of

people talked about it already what was

the pin code they could in on the bottom

I think it was a six digit code all the

bombs had the same pin code

does anyone know anyone want to guess

all of us got cats

that's awesome oh yeah with zero zero

zero zero zero zero zero there you go

so people defeated the mechanism so even

though they look like the head I'm

making this in there I didn't so command

and control that was all the preamble to

set the context now let's think of the

problem in general I like to think about

it like this I don't know if you've seen

the movie avatar is a very strange movie

but in it who's seen it not if you've

seen it yeah yeah and you've certainly

seen shows like it like a whole lot of

Japanese animes like this I'm pretty

sure even transformers and things like

this and maybe even the Mighty Morphin

Power Rangers go back in times like this

the idea was in Avatar

there was this have I told you this

already

yes no there was this big suit and the

hero I can't remember much about the

movie except they had a rare element

called unobtainium which I thought was

very funny but I do remember they had a

big suit and here are climbs in the big

suit and holds these controls and then

by moving the controls in his suit then

he's inside some sort of giant robot and

it mimics his movements and it's much

lighter than him like surgeons can do

you know they put on these gloves and

then they do an operation using the

gloves and a million miles away

someplace the robot hands carry out the

operation mimicking the person stuff but

in Avatar the point was he was a small

person operating these controls but he

was in some sort of ginormous machine

and massively magnified his power so if

he went pulling like this then the

massive machine become warm and a being

incredibly so um I think of armies as

being a bit like that

that you've got one person at the top

that has this idea like let's attack

that he'll attack it now and then

somehow through the mechanism of command

and control that goes down to a million

people or a thousand people or a hundred

thousand people and they will run up

that hill in attacking and that and then

the general says everyone now dig

trenches over there and then everyone

takes trenches and suddenly there's a

million trenches everywhere because

these generals controlling a million

people so that's pretty cool when he

gives the general enormous power so if

the general then puts on his robot suit

and the general of the other country

puts on his robot suit and whoever's got

the biggest army the biggest robot will

tend to win so you can see why generals

like this and it's no good if you're

doing this and you say everyone attacked

that hill now and then someone says ah I

really want to or can I do it later on

let my daughter say wash out the dishes

no can I do it later on I need to do

procrastination first or yeah let's

debate about that I mean you want to

attack that hill I think you know if

everyone's doing that then you don't

have your whole suit magnifying

everything you've got a whole lot of

people talking bickering and arguing and

debating months themselves and you how

hard a plan doesn't get carried out so

this is whole idea in the military in

here I'm speaking with no action

we'll experience in the military at all

so I could be completely wrong but I'm

certainly reading a lot of ripping yarns

books when I was young about all sorts

of things like that my understanding in

the militaries is that one thing that's

very valued is this chain of command

thing and then when you get an order you

have to carry it out and you can use

intuitive your intuition and cunning and

clever thinking to carry out the order

better or work out good ways of carrying

it out but you would never question the

order you do what you're told that's

what you have to do so the idea being

that's the old-fashioned idea and I sort

of think of it as being like pyramids so

I often think the King of England the

Pharaoh of Egypt the Pharaoh would say

you know when I'm dead I don't want a

normal-sized grave I want something

shaped like this but I want it really

big really really big

everyone do it now and then everyone in

Egypt just drops everything and builds

this thing for the for the Pharaoh and

they believe blocks or anything and they

build this pyramid and what I think is

so funny about that

is of course that's exactly what they're

drilling is a picture of the power

structure that the parent of the pharaoh

invented it's entirely a pyramid power

structure with him at the top giving

orders and they run down the bottom

trying it out so that's pretty cool but

here's my and this you can see lots of

good things about having a tight command

and control in a pyramid shape and you

can probably see like think imagine and

think of lots of other ones but there is

a problem too which is the general or

the pharaoh has the strength of a

million people but the pharaoh only has

still the brain of one person so you've

got a normal person with really big

muscles

whereas if everyone talks a bit and

debates and argues and thinks about it

and has in depends on individual agency

and things like that then you've got a

million people all doing mean things a

lot of them cancel each other out but

you've got a million brains in there so

you have the potential to be more

creative or more lateral thinking and I

remember reading these ripping yarn

books when I was a boy the desert rats

the idea of

people being guerrilla forces

essentially so you're up against some

big army like the German army in the

desert but instead of attacking the army

with another army equally big these

people just did little commando raids

and they went behind the enemy lines and

they all did individual crazy things and

really confuse the other army and it

just was really powerful and effective

and in a way that's why terrorists do -

I mean once you have a really big

organized synchronized power structure

in society then these little little

things that come in that can make little

changes unexpectedly without announcing

they're invading and having a big

visible army moving in ever and marching

lockstep but you could sort of stop or

see but just one little lone person

looking just like everyone else causing

a bit of chaos actually that can be

quite disruptive and often they're

called stainless steel rats if you've

ever in Harry Harrison this idea that

even in a big stainless steel city in

the city of the Fugees little rats so

that's my thought about power structure

be so power structure a is the pyramid

has the strength example is very

effective everyone's working in unison

lots of amazing things can happen and

then power the structure be where maybe

were no power at all and everything's

all equal in everyone's arguing and

debating and forming committees deciding

what to do that's very much harder to

achieve anything but but you've got a

lot more creative thinking going on so

no it's hopefully you know from this

course we're never gonna say one of

these is good and bad you know just fit

for purpose and each one of them has

strengths and weaknesses but if you just

stick to one of those and it's not ideal

so then if we go back to the whole

corona thing again

it's pretty clear from reading if all

the information is correct that China

adopted a command and control structure

and was very effective there was one

person saying we should do this and they

did it and they carried it out

ruthlessly and in synchrony and it's

amazingly effective and then Italy had

this big chaotic mess whoever I'm

talking about what they're gonna do and

the government saying oh we should

isolate now and sometimes yeah I don't

know and and maybe they had a more fun

time over there but in time of crisis

sometimes you just need everyone to act

together to solve the problem and

everyone doing different things is

actually a bit of a problem so you can

see that there's advantages

disadvantages to both and I suspect our

we're seeing that playing it now with

America versus China in the corona thing

America has got this complete chaotic

everyone doing everything and maybe

that'll work

maybe they'll you know pull through it

amazingly well somehow and they'll be

really well equipped and then China's

going to the other extreme and maybe

that'll work

and then we're sort of in the middle of

them maybe maybe I don't know but it's

sort of interesting to see their to what

extent you want to have command and

control rigorous command control in

force from above and to what extent you

won't have individual freedom and

liberty and creativity now though to

talk a little bit I love called that

centralization versus decentralization

but of course as much one there this one

talk about a little bit of history just

a brilliant context so the Greeks were

wealthy they had a lovely their own sort

of an intersection of a whole lot of

trading routes the early early cities

they had a lovely climate everything was

good and they had kings like everyone

did in those days that took most of

their wealth from them and then the

people in Athens eventually got really

annoyed that they had a city eventually

with a lot of people that started acting

together and they said it's not really

fair the king just doesn't do anything

it takes all the money and we do all the

work and he takes some money from us and

they united and together throughout the

king now they couldn't have done that it

was just one or two of them but the city

had a whole lot of people in it and then

they acted in synchrony and coordinated

attack and together they were powerful

the king of the Kings and they said we

will never have Kings again we want to

just rule ourselves and look after

ourselves so then they made a decider of

democracy which was everyone has a vote

never nice to say and they tried to set

up a power structure without Kings now

what's the danger here the danger the

fear they always had was one day the

Kings will come back as we've seen in

countries around the world recently talk

about a second you throw out the person

that's the believe that bullies have run

around and it runs all nice but then the

bully somehow gets back the Canadians

have a great example of this

we're anyway I went over that's very

funny I'll tell you one day it's a funny

story there but anyway so the idea was

the Greeks thought how can we stop these

Kings coming back because we still need

to have someone in charge if everyone

just sits around arguing all the time

we'll never get anything done the road

will never get built so it's all and

they could be put in place and the

rubbish will never be picked up we do

need a boss to tell us what to do and

have anarchy so but as soon as we pick a

boss what's going to stop them grabbing

more and more and more power for

themselves and then eventually there'll

be a king again and they put in place

they thought about it really hard and

they're put in place a whole lot of

mechanisms to stop that happening and

those mechanisms they came up with two

and a half thousand years later are

still the basis for most democracies

that are effective and that the

democracies don't put their good ideas

in place tend to get overthrown and go

back to or solitary enraging so what

were their mechanisms where you might

want to look it up and think about it

but let me tell you some of them from my

reading of it but they're certainly well

worth studying because I wanted to solve

this problem they came up with a really

good solution oh by the way if you

compare Athens and Sparta you're sort of

comparing the two command control

structures and so here's the thing they

said we'll appoint someone to be in

charge but one point one will appoint

two they call them pray tours or

something or consult and then they

attend equal power so they had two

people doing what's your Vantage of to

do some want to say one at one

crickets that's so awesome

I've always wanted to ask a question

there to be silence and then just

crickets and now it's happened is my

dream come true or tumbleweed maybe

Lauren is there a tumbleweed behind you

somewhere

oh I'll keep an eye out if I spot one

rolling part I'm gonna build one that's

gonna be my so yeah what do you reckon

someone say anyone less chance of both

of them going and trying to get maximum

power when you have someone to keep you

Hey that's absolutely right sorry Lauren

I don't want to pick on you and make

that was what Samantha yeah basically

their interests don't exactly aligned

did I tell you that line from the Thomas

Crown Affair Josh I've already went mr.

crown when would you ever is there a can

you imagine any circumstance in which

you'd ever trust a woman because he

doesn't ever wants to get in a

relationship and he says yeah if her

interests didn't diverge too far from my

own and I thought that's not about

relationships and love that's about life

you can trust someone if their interests

line up with yours

and so what the Greeks tried to do is

very clever they tried to get two

peoples whose interests didn't exactly

line up so it's harder for them to

collude and so if one of them went bad

the other would be good and of course if

they did line up the new trauma

so yeah that's exactly right and then

but they did all sorts of other things

like the term and that person was very

short this is something that most

democracies have so if you're in power

it's just you can't help but the more

you're empowered the more you like it

and you try and set things up to keep

the power there and to make life more

comfortable for you and a great example

this is schools if any of you know

someone who's a student teaching about

to go to a school ask them to do an

investigation for you can tell you what

it's like because I bet I'd bet a

million dollars well I bet the

tumbleweed that I'm about to construct

that when they go to their school they

will get all the crap classes they'll

get the classes no on once they'll get

the trouble classes they won't get the

fun classes they'll get to teach you I

don't know you know in the bottom

violent classes they'll get all the

nasty things

why is that Chile classes are handed out

randomly or fairly no it turns out the

longer you're in a school the more

powerful you get the more people listen

to your opinion and more people are a

little bit scared of you maybe or

something so the more senior teachers

are more powerful and long behold

they're telling it better classes so

people when in power just tend to use

the power to advance their aims and if

you like being in power than one of your

own says to keep power so it's more or

less invariable as soon as you get into

power you try and change things so you

can stay in power can anyone think of

examples of that happening so the Greek

thing is oh sorry I should say the great

thing is you can't be in power for too

long so once you're in there for a year

for six months you're gone and then we

appoint two more and then two more and

so on the idea is hopefully no one can

actually stuff up the system enough in

those 12 months to keep them in power

can anyone think of examples of

countries which have this rule that you

can't be in power for too long and can

you think of times it's been broken

Russia right now right now Putin it's so

funny isn't it you've got to read this

and they've got a president and a prime

minister and they're supposed to not be

aligning but they're best friends in

fact I think the other one and I can't

remember which is which cuz I think

Putin if I'm probably get it backwards

but I think he was Prime Minister

I think he was Prime Minister Prime

Minister I think he going to be Prime

Minister for two terms so then he became

president for the next term and put his

sock puppet in his Prime Minister then I

think he was president for a while and

then he decided he'd become Prime

Minister again because you can and now

he's been in Prime Minister again or

president I can never remember which for

twice whichever one he is becomes for

the time he's in it the powerful real

position and now is his times about to

elapse and it looks like he can't by the

Constitution be president or prime

minister any longer so what's he trying

to do does anyone know do you know tom

yeah he's trying to keep power I think

he's trying to modify the Constitution

it's might of why the Constitution guys

we've got to change this this is crazy

wrong there that says I can't be present

anymore and I think there's even a vote

coming up and he still wants to hold it

once ever I asked to go out and vote so

he can keep his power but it's not just

him I think if you started watching the

news now you'll find in every country

people try

extend the power and their time in power

and and the idea of having two people

that you have to coerce to get power

that's called checks and balances that's

an example of a chicken or a balance so

you're trying to have things that limit

your power when you're in power so you

can't just do what you want so we have

checks and balances in Australia what

limits a power of the Prime Minister

crickets crickets so-so laws do he has

to follow the law well he can change the

law oh yeah but I've got the

Constitution the Constitution set up to

be really hard to change for that exact

reason oh okay

well then does he have to obey the law

well he doesn't control the police the

police are sort of independent yes they

should be part of the operational side

part of the you know the public service

side and the public servants who carry

out his orders they're supposed to be

sort of independent of the politicians

and the judges who decide yes or no and

about how do you can change the laws and

when you can change those there again

independent and they're actually so

independent that they're appointed for

life so until they get old intent on so

or old so that means they don't even

have to suck up to the government to get

their appointment renewed because the

government can't get rid of them so they

are like the two craters that checks and

balances so we have all these checks and

balances in the system but you can say

as soon as someone gets into power first

thing they try and do is undermine all

the checks and balances so they'll

grumble about the judiciary and try and

run them down and to publicize and

they'll if the judges ever do anything

they don't like they'll say all the

judges are making law that's not right

and they'll take over the public service

and they may actually have that happened

about ten years ago they changed all the

leaders of all the areas of the public

servants to be political appointments on

short term contracts with KPIs

with the discretion of the government to

renew them or not and by corroding the

person person at the top whose job it is

now as to keep the minister happy rather

than look after their portfolio and do

their job by corrupting at the top then

the corruption sort of goes the whole

way down because everyone has to so the

public service is being eroded

we have sometimes something called the

Fifth Estate which is the newspapers

that if you're doing bad stuff

newspapers report on in the sense

there if you think of the country it's

like a system there are whistleblower in

the system and loading people when

things go wrong

so then governments will try and the the

media that don't support the government

the government's will try and corrupt or

corrode and run down or disempower or

defund or yeah so for example Trump

hates all the media that brought

attention to him and yeah he's

effectively disempowering them this

whole idea of fake news is quite a

deadly Hardy so you'll see leaders do

this all time so find some countries

around the world where it's happening

you don't have to pick Australia or

America it happens everywhere I think

lots of South American countries have

done it recently and pretty sure the

Philippines have done it think oh

Malaysia of course is a classic example

just look up countries and you'll find

that people get to power and then oh oh

Turkey turkey Turkey Oh what happened in

Turkey so read about that the Prime

Minister or whatever he's called their

president whenever amazing amazing how

he's managed to undermine checks and

balances left right and center and turn

into an effective leadership oh yeah

yeah lots of those examples even around

so look look at those and see that's

just natural naturally what happens with

power so we looked at Kings we looked at

democracy yeah so this is the other

thing I wanted to get to so a Draco

who's in the time of the Greeks he was

one of the first people that brought in

laws that everyone had to follow I mean

they had laws before that sort of verbal

but he broke them all down so it was

sort of written down laws and that was a

check-in imbalance on Iran the law was

sort of bigger than individual people

you had to pay the law

the reason draconian the word draconian

named after Draco is all these laws were

really mean and strict and you might

have a covered encountered organizations

that have rules like that

so he was you know basically if you

stole a cabbage off with your head is

every law said and it can break this law

death break this Lord death parking

after 3 p.m. in a clear way death so but

that was interesting and then the Romans

who copied a lot of the ideas from the

Greeks and setting up the system a

command and control system for power and

again trying to stop power

I'm concentrated and an essentially

translated Republic rather than becoming

an empire again with an emperor or who's

it you know leader he had this I'm sorry

I'm still in the time of the oh no I

can't remember it's a Greeks or the

Romans in among Roman I was going to say

to Roman the dictators but were the

dictators for the Greeks I think it was

the Romans and the Greeks had a similar

idea but the word dictator actually was

initially a good work not a bad word

what it meant was in a time of crisis we

we love sitting around talking in our

togas and and debating and arguing and

having silly plays and things you know

we're Greeks or Romans we love doing all

that but we realize that in times of

crisis you can't do that you need a

strong leader who's going to lead and

everyone to unified and sadly everyone

needs to form a robot and we need to be

really big and so they would temporarily

appoint someone called the dictator was

just six months and their job would be

to solve this problem and they had

various roles but this is one of them I

can't pronounce alone anyone that can

pronounce Latin might be an aside but

this appoint them for the matter to be

done so that's sort of what we need now

with coronavirus we really just need to

appoint a dictator who come in and just

take control of situation everyone has

to obey their laws and they deal with

the crisis because for a crisis the

dictators are really good thing you do

want everyone to be a robot carrying out

things but the main third main trick is

the dictator at the end of the six

months or as soon as the thing is over

whichever happens sooner I had to stop

being a dictator and just went back to

being a normal citizen and the danger

here I guess is that there'll be lots of

power accreting up to the states and the

large financial organizations to deal

with this crisis and everyone I'll say

stop checks and balances let's just go

for it let's go nuts and they will solve

the problem but at the end you'll end up

with a system because this is what

always happens where the people in power

now much more powerful and they won't

give it back and they won't want to put

any causes on their end of the thing

okay so what's the danger with a

dictator because you won't think of

dictator I mean it sounds like a good

model if you hadn't been Everland

dictator someone who's really nice and

wise and then that I had ruthless like

in for example in military protect books

the

the head of the city Lord patrician he

was a dictator but here's a benevolent

dictator and terry pratchett points out

in a way that's a really good thing to

have someone with awesome powers who

uses them for good and can actually get

things done the danger with a dictator

is this concept we keep coming back to

over and over again which is single

points of failure I'm just talking all

the time and you're not seeing me you're

seeing that slide the same slide for

hours how boring was that and I was

juggling and doing all sorts of things

and I showed you my tumbleweed and so I

put my face back on can see me hello

hello so dictators or the whole robot

idea the Emperor idea the pyramid idea

the problem is the top is a single point

of failure so if the person and this was

the problem the Americans faced that

they refused to sort of admit I think

during the nuclear thing they didn't

want to have it that the soldiers had

free will essentially they had to carry

out the orders of their offices and the

office had to carry out the orders of

their officers and those offers an

etiquette of the generals and the

generals have to carry the orders of the

president and the whole thing is

absolutely perfect as long as your

president is awesome but if your

presidents an idiot and issues orders

that you really shouldn't be following

Wow that's tricky what should you do so

it's a single point of failure if you've

got a whole system where you've got the

brain of one person and the muscles of a

million and the that one person is

really just a giant baby or an idiot or

corrupt or something like that then

you're in big trouble and we're seeing

that with the show that's just coming

out that I haven't seen I don't know if

I'm going to called the plot against

America based on their an excellent book

by Philip Roth where they look at what

would happen to America if a dictator

did come to power and of course it would

be really popular with people people

like strong leaders that get things done

but of course what they'll do is they'll

agree pout and sauce

um okay yeah let's keep going that's not

against America no checks and balances

oh yeah so the idea of checks and

balances you put limits on everything

dictators and had their role for six

months and now I'm going to put the

screen back to screen sharing so you

don't want to watch me reading the notes

does anyone want to say anything while

I'm fiddling around with this so I'm

just what certify hey is that Evan hi

yeah I recognize your voice how's

everyone going at home is everyone okay

yes I'm just looking at it runs faces

there's lots of smiles and half smiles

that's really nice well I hope you are

guys hope we can get through this and be

good people still at the end and I mean

and we will we will as soon as we assess

what we have to do then we will okay so

the plot against America checks and

balances the estates here they're

different estates I think I mentioned

the press is sometimes called the fifth

estate but the idea is you've got these

separate organs that will look after

each other so you've got the executive

body like their president the Prime

Minister and then you've got the public

service and then you've got the

judiciary independent of them and you've

got the police are hopefully separate to

everyone the Army's hopefully separate

or earn and you've got the media

hopefully separate or rounds but

academics annoying you've run in the

background criticizing and grumbling

about things like that

wonderful Norman Swan does so the idea

is you've got all these different voices

and for the system to get stuffed you

have to actually corrupt and stuff five

different voices and it's hard to do I

was remember when I was in Cambodia

someone was telling me I didn't know the

full story of the Khmer Rouge but that

the first thing he did was he asked us

such a sad story he said we want to

rebuild this country make it fantastic

and I need all the great thinkers and

all the teachers and all the all the

people who are good at and other lawyers

and judges and the former leaders and

police people all these people that know

about how to make a good country I need

you all to come into the city and tell

us how to run the country and then of

course they all came you knew just

you'll do so as a country that just lost

his teachers and its lawyers and its

doctors in fact even went around killing

anyone with glasses on apparently

because I'm more likely to be

intellectual

just trying to silence all those other

voices so yeah all right and leaders

like leading yeah like dr. Strangelove

we saw at the end of dr. Strangelove

when they were planning how they would

survive the Holocaust lo and behold they

were all going to be quite well off

though the survival plan was sort of

looking after them and like Douglas

Adams said and then when they go and

find the ruler of the galaxy the person

who's actually running the galaxy and

they say how did you get this job and it

turns out the number one criteria for

getting the job of being the ruler or

the whole galaxy is to not want to be

the ruler of the whole galaxy and often

which we had that in politics that you

couldn't get elected unless she didn't

want to be elected and I think there

been some great leaders in history of

being like that George Washington for

example he only wanted to be in power

for a little while and then once

everything was okay they kept asking

I'll come back roll us again he said no

it's too tempting I'll stuff things up

you go and find someone else you're on

your own now what a great guy um covered

19 I think we talked about that so I

know I wanted to talk about when I went

out to Byron Bay at ages ago I remember

I was so happy so nice and we went to

this stall by the beach and they were

selling delicious ice creams and I went

up to the guy who was serving ice creams

and said and I haven't that one and that

one and that one can I have three

different flavors in the cone and he

looked at me like I was an idiot and he

said don't speak to me you gotta speak

to the girl at the counter up there I

said huh I went up to the counter at the

other end the cash register like three

feet away there's dis Jam you know tiny

little trolley and I said um I'd like

those three flavors and she says okay

and she tucked him into a computer and

then prints out a little receipt and

hands it to me and then I took a step to

the side and handed the receipt to the

guy and he said okay and then he made

the ice cream and gave it to me and I

thought what what why why are they doing

that what's the point of it and it

wasn't till I started studying security

and thing about command control

structures and I realized what was going

on can anyone think why why on earth if

you were the owner of that business did

you have two people doing that well

probably

so you don't get mace rights so you

don't get mates right yeah that's good

one was that Oliver yeah yeah well then

yeah more keep going that's that's part

of it I was just like you can't be

serving your friend you have to go and

get your other friend like you have to

befriend everyone yeah yeah yeah yeah

that's right too corrupt this system you

have to corrupt to people because I

guess the person that ran the system

didn't trust the backpackers he had

running his ice cream store and to make

this break you have to break to and

think about it there's all sorts of

different attacks and this stops most of

them one of them is the server now one

of them is the person who collects the

money doesn't collect the right amount

of money because there's no way of

checking the amount of money being

collected corresponds to the amount of

ice cream going out except at the end of

the day I guess you could weigh the van

see how much old way the ice cream tubs

and see how much it's gone but it

wouldn't let you really pinpoint what

had gone wrong just that something

invalid and probably you couldn't even

do that easily because there's probably

different prices for volumes I knew some

things probably hard to actually compute

so yeah basically I'd have to I can't

get mates rights also the girl can't

steal money from the till why can't she

steal money from the till why can't you

just collect the money say here's your

ice cream and keep the money excluded in

a pocket cuz it's on record how many

things were purchased yeah it's on

record because she has to produce this

receipt to give to him in order for him

to get the ice cream and the receipt is

produced by the system that produces

record so record is forced to be kept of

all the money she's put in and I the

customer will enforce that because I

really want my ice cream and as long as

the other guys not in cahoots with her

if they're in cahoots in your stuff but

as long as the other guys not in cahoots

with her he's not gonna give the ice

cream out without the thing so it's just

yeah that's really good you might want

to think of all the other attacks you

can carry it on the ice cream stall and

see how many of these it protects you

against protect you against most of them

can anyone think of an attack it doesn't

protect you against

the guy said

himself Oscar the guy serving himself I

was great yes or I wasn't even thinking

that but it's it's the same it's a nicer

version of what I was doing I think you

pay for two but he gives you six you

know so if you've corrupted him you

record that a payment happened but

there's actually no way of knowing what

he hands out

anyway this is a general idea of a

principle known as double entry

bookkeeping the idea being a Mis sort of

revolutionize finance so around the time

that the MIDI she's in Italy like in the

Renaissance time a business is used to

be just family businesses so you

wouldn't cheat because you're cheating

your family or yourself but what if you

were a really big business and you had

branches in other cities why you get

your uncle or your aunt or your cousin

to run the branch and it's a big family

and if I trust each other sort of works

yeah but what if you getting really big

so big you run out of relatives you

trust well then you put strangers in

that your sort of trust maybe you've

worked with them and you become but can

you do that or we know the answer is no

you can't even trust your relatives but

no one wants to admit that and you can't

trust anyone because anyone can become

corrupt because insiders happen all the

time and corruption happens all the time

and people feather their own nest all

times your nature so how can you keep

control on a business in another city

that you don't even see all that happens

is maybe once a month they send you all

the profits how do you know they're

sending in the right amount of profits

so this very clever system called double

entry bookkeeping was invented where

essentially it's what we are in the

general term for all these things we

talk about now is called dual control

you want to have essentially two things

happening that aren't exactly lined up

so you'd have to fake or break both of

them to break the system so a Jew can

you think I'll talk a bit about this so

the idea being in double entry

bookkeeping you might want to read out

about it but actually it's finally most

people when they write about it the

accountants and people they talk about

how wonderful it is and they talk they

talk about all sorts of details it's

very hard to find anyone that actually

talks about it from a security point of

view they talk about I don't know it's

really weird but it's just very clearly

a brilliant security mechanism so if you

can find a good book about it years ago

I did find a good book about it that

blew me away and recently I bought a

couple of other books

more about double-entry bookkeeping and

they just they talk about how good it is

and they're going on and on about it and

talking about the history but they're

not talking about it in terms of a dual

control system being but they just talk

about it I think they just like numbers

so anyone that can find any more

information about why it's good that'll

be great

but basically with double-entry

bookkeeping and I've never done I've

only read about it is you keep two

different books everything goes in both

books and both books have to counsel or

consignor reconcile so you have to fake

both books to fake something or you have

to change both books to change something

now hopefully the way the books are set

up is either it's like the ice cream

stall so it's in the interest of the

customer that the books arrived like it

was in my interest that I get the ice

cream so it's some sort of checking

there or you have different people doing

the different books or something like

that and it's funny these days we still

do double entry bookkeeping

but a 10 star will be down inside a

single software package like mind your

own business I can't help but think

that's a random mine's a lot of the

goodness of it because if you can crop

the package you can crop both books I

mean what's the point of having it in

two books if they're both honorable by

the same person it's the same thing you

know maybe that's a useful way of saying

the information but it's you're losing

your security mechanism double entry

bookkeeping no anyway double entry

bookkeeping very interesting

I like the idea have to corrupt to

people oh yeah I was going to say with

phones I think we talked about that with

authentication last week the the old old

idea of yeah maybe someone's hacked into

their bank account but they won't have

access to their mobile phone in their

pocket so I'll send a sim miss it's in

an SMS message to the phone and people

have to prove they had the phone in

order to respond to that so it's like

two different controls as I call the two

different factors in authentication but

you can see that's not really dual

control anymore because if someone gets

your phone then um okay I think we're

nearly there

bookkeeping ice cream oh we're down at

all now the we're gonna have a little

break and I'm gonna show you a fun movie

to control the conclusion to the whole

thing oh yeah

no this isn't the conclusion it's just

an interesting thing to remember in the

opening sequence we saw four wargames

when they went into the bunker and they

were told to launching missiles and all

sorts of things like that and went

through quite a lot of elaborate

physical security and protocols protocol

security to get in there and I really

advise everyone to watch that again and

just think about all the different

elements that happened as they went in

can anyone think of an example of dual

control that happened in that whole

scenario when they were flicking it over

to be like on internal operation they

had the one person read and checklist in

the person checking oh so then again Tom

I know I thought you were saying

something else so my ears would I was

hearing what I wanted to hear um they

were like closing off the base and there

was one guy who was flicking all the

switches closed off the base and the

other guy was watching it and jacking oh

oh yeah and that's not the clip at the

beginning that's one we actually watch

it in the afternoon oh right sorry yeah

yeah that's right yeah someone does

something and someone else watches and

checks that yeah that's really good yeah

yeah and you'll have seen that too in

dr. Strangelove that sequence in the

cockpit you know people do something

someone calls it out someone else checks

it in fact that's going to dual control

to stop corruption that's dual control

to stop errors the idea being that two

people are less likely to make an error

than one person and that's a really

really good person example and I think

we talked about that before up slightly

before with errors and computers that

are not talking about elections that we

make errors but they tend to be random

errors and of course the problem if

you've got a computer and you say ah now

we've got rid of errors well you've got

rid of all the random errors but you've

still got your systemic errors and now

you don't have the way of

double-checking catching so for example

in old days when I was an actuary that

was so boring and here's an example of

how it would be boring sometimes I have

to read I have to actually manually type

in a whole lot of figures into we did it

all and pen and paper and then you do it

on a calculator and you'd write the

answers on pen and paper and then at the

end you'd have to enter it all into the

computer to do something else and you

had to get it right and sometimes

you were doing you know 20 digit

calculations and you had to enter it

correctly so we had a rule that anything

that got sent out to the client two

people had to sign off on him so had to

be checked by everything had to be done

by one person and checked by another

person and that's a sort of dual control

for errors and because you know this

little chance you'll both make the same

errors it's sort of why we like pair

programming if you think the paper

programming one of the reasons is so

powerful is it's like those shades well

they're you know those savers that the

ads for those they show one blade gets

passed once over by one hair gets passed

one of the blades but then the next

blade picks up that here does everyone

see those ads maybe they're from a long

time ago

yeah Lyra you've seen them but you're

from a long time ago like me - so anyway

I should find a picture of those ads

because that's a great example so that's

why we do pip program one of the reasons

we do paper and you'll notice it's the

exact opposite of command and control

got some command and control you don't

question that actually is a point other

so so I was I saying

too many diversions people read oh yeah

so we do these calculations when I was

an actuary and I had this way of

checking and I still do it with numbers

if it's a critical number I'm typing in

so for example on my banking up if I

have to be pay someone or transfer money

to another account and it's in a system

that I'm not confident if I missed you

still anyone ever done that it's quite

frightening you type in the account

number you think I've got a digit wrong

I've just said all that money or 52

cents I've sent to the wrong person and

I'll never get it back so I want to make

sure I've typed the account number

incorrectly how do I check that

well I always get oh I try to get one of

my daughters to read the number back and

I checked well I did the trick we used

to do when we were actuaries which is

she reads the number out backwards so I

type it in forwards and then when we're

checking we read it backwards because I

think you can sometimes make the same

error when you read a number the doubles

and triples or similar runs leak errors

but if you read something backwards your

list so I can even check myself by doing

something backwards because I'm less

like

to make the same error whereas if I've

said it once in my head that singsong

list of all the numbers the next time

I'm reading it out I'm probably doing

the same scene so I'm gonna probably

remembering what I said part time and my

eyes are seeing what I'm remembering and

singing in my head a bit like I did when

Tom Agee's said his thing I was I

thought he was saying what I wanted him

to say and he was saying something else

and it took quite a while for me to

realize because I was projecting my

words onto him

so yeah reading it backwards is a good

way of being slightly independent with

yourself but getting someone else to do

it even better and also when I'm

proofreading documents so for example

there's a legal contract and I have to

check that I've got an identical copy

that someone else has maybe with their

hand written or something I don't know

why we do that but it has happened

sometimes so how I always check the two

copies of the same is one person reads

and one person checks but we read the

words backwards because again if you're

reading backwards all the semantic

meanings loss and it's just a series of

words and you can check the words

because if you're reading four words you

start anticipating what's going to come

next you start seeing what's a you don't

notice typos and things because you're

seeing what you expect so as much as

possible try and do checking that's

independent Tom said the people one

person was doing that one person was

checking in airplanes and we'll talk

about this later on and disasters and

accidents for safety people who invented

checklists and there's an IDE there's an

almost dual control idea with a

checklist which is in order to make

something safe go through this list and

there's a checklist for every

eventuality and often during a crash or

if there's some problem with a plane or

a crisis pilot will quickly start going

through the checklist of things they've

got to do someone's pre computed all the

steps they're supposed to do the idea is

so you read the step and then you carry

it out and you often read the words as

you're carrying them out and also at the

time you're executing it it might not be

possible to dual control it but maybe

when the checklist is produced it was

dual controlled and that maybe two or

three sensible people looked at the

checklist to see if that you're

overlooking or omitting things before it

was made and print it out so you're just

moving the checking in time that you're

controlling time so check this out in a

way an example of that so Tom's right

the other one I was thinking of from the

movie though is when they're in the

opening sequence Tom when they were

turning the two keys you had to have two

people turning the key in order to

enable the system the keys were placed

far enough apart that one person

couldn't reach to both so that was an

example of job control you need to have

two people agreeing to launch all right

it's very long I mean just looking

through my notes is there anything else

I really wanted to say there all right

can I show you this video now do you

want to see a video or do you want to

get up and move around what do you want

to do Lily and what do you want to do

okay

everyone move around a little bit I'm

gonna move around too and I'll meet you

back here in what like four minutes does

that sound good

get some exercise you can play the video

while we move around oh yeah I could

what do you think of that Lily

sound good alright I'll play the video

it's a five-minute video that's perfect

let me just work out how to do it am i

sharing the screen already oh I thought

I'd never seen me you've seen the screen

it's probably nicer disease we can see

both actually how do you see both what

do you do I don't know yeah your your

photo comes up as like a little thing in

the top of the screen and there are

configuration options yeah I think a

more competent lecturer would know about

all that wouldn't you think Tom I I try

not to make any comments about my

lecturers but I think you're a very

confident lecturer you know it's funny

you were saying then I know you're

saying I was completely hopeless but my

ears were hearing what I wanted to hear

yet again all right let me play this

video I really love this video and

please

it has I can't remember it has bad

language is potentially slightly

offensive I just want to run to know

this is just entirely satirical I think

I'm pretty loaded it already out of here

oh yeah don't forget to move around we

should

[Music]

yes who's only seen in Tim America will

police say Nora listen yeah so this is

our next topic which is assets so the

idea being insecurity we're protecting

stuff what are we protecting we're

protecting our assets what are our

assets you'd be surprised how many times

people forget to ask that question they

just jump in and start protecting let's

just protect protect protect protect but

actually you got to work it out what is

it you're trying to protect what are

your assets so we're not gonna talk

about just briefly how you might go

about doing that and mainly the point of

this is to say don't forget to work out

what your assets are don't forget to

work out what you're trying to protect

so in this in this clip here what we see

is they are trying to stop some

terrorists which is of course a good

thing to do and they destroyed the

Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe and the

Eiffel Tower and

that's a pity so the question is yeah

sacrifices we made I mean this is part

of the thing I was talking about before

that some we have this thing that we

just did good at focusing on one thing

at a time

but actually although that's easy and

convenient and makes really good

rhetoric there part of the trick I've

found about being an adult is trying to

juggle a whole lot of balance not juggle

balance a whole lot of different

competing things and there's never a

perfect solution even though movies

there always is and you just have to be

really careful in in whatever you do to

solve a problem that you make sure

because you'll never solve it perfectly

and you'll create new problems when you

try and solve it so you just sort of got

to make sure that you do the best you

can and you can't do the best you can by

just going if you've got instinct

because you've got instincts going to be

wrong you're gonna pick one thing we

call it the movie hypothesis you'll pick

one thing on that's and you'll try and

stop that one thing so like a Hollywood

movie it's only about one thing there's

only one thing they've got to carry out

all the other things are important and

the one things normally big and scary

and obvious and standing out sewn but

actually life you got to balance all

these hundreds of different things and

my favorite movies often a ones where

you know someone achieves some goal I

said that too at the beginning but you

sort of wistfully realize our way

through that they've lost something else

that's equally important as one so what

we were seeing in that Team America clip

II it was exactly that that okay we've

got to stop terrorists because terrorism

isn't bad

why is terrorism bad probably not from

the number of capable people are kills

because we've talked about that before a

number of people killed by road

accidents or smoking is much worse but

we still give lots of money to tobacco

companies and we like them and normal

human beings go and work in them even

though they're killing more people than

terrorists and we don't try and kill

them so you know lots of bad things

happen in the world probably the bad

thing about terrorism the thing that

makes it so pervasive is it gets in our

mind of course is terror it makes it run

unhappy and that has this effect of

focusing on our attention and then once

we focus our attention on something we

want to get rid of it so it is like the

shiny distracting object that we can't

help but look at and terror in society

is no good I mean part of society is

just living a happy life and feeling

safe Felix

probably even more important than being

safe and terrorism corrodes and attacks

that so it is you know it is attacking a

really important asset we have our sense

of safety from the USM party every night

al-qaeda only exists because I can only

see fragments of the comments they're

sort of loose if they're a bit like

haikus I'll read the full comments later

on and next week I'll work out how to

have comments and pictures showing so

yeah it is tricky so the question is is

there's this famous line be careful what

you wish for I think probably everyone

knows that that you wish for something

and you could get it and it's in all

cultures and mythologies and stories and

fables and probably religions as well

this idea that you really wish for

something and then you get it and you

realize to get it you've you've lost

something that's more important like

journaling that Joni Mitchell song paved

paradise but like a parking lot the big

yellow taxi song you know you really

want a parking lot but at the end

you've lost paradise or you really want

you know you you want to achieve you

want this a lot of my people I know

really wanted to become wealthy that was

the shining object that attracted their

attention and they've managed to

optimize and succeed and do that and

they have become very wealthy but along

the way I just think they might have

lost a lot of happiness in their lives

and and probably they picked the wrong

thing to optimize it so anyway that's

the general discussion around assets now

let's just look at assets let me just

kill Tim America World Police and go

back to the lecture notes and make sure

that I'm not that you can see them maybe

I should share them

[Music]

right here module five slides so we've

got to come up we got to work out what

the assets are and that what the things

are you're trying to protect

now your security people so you probably

know the first question you should ask

when you've faced with a difficult

question it's like this isn't something

you can stick into a formula and you get

the right answer is asking a question

where the leaves the computer and enters

the real world which is as a human being

or as an organization or as a company or

a university or whatever what's

important to you and so I obviously

you're the only one that can answer that

and your company's anyone they can

answer that but as a security person we

should think how can this process fail

what could go wrong with this if we sit

down to what their assets are and the

most obvious failure and it does happen

all the time these people overlook large

important things and don't notice it

till later on and probably I did that

when I was preparing for the Corona

withdrawal a restaurant getting lots of

things and then now I'm here and we

withdrawn I keep thinking I forgot I

didn't think of and there's whole

categories of things I didn't even think

of um so I think risk is you will forget

a whole category of assets

you won't notice that lose if that makes

sense so so I think the biggest risk is

you just won't identify the assets you

should be particularly so let's look at

mechanisms for identifying all the

assets and these are just rules of thumb

for me and they're not guaranteed to

work but they're better than nothing

they're like a checklist but I don't

what I don't want you to do because you

could in some courses when they teach

assets they just give you a checklist of

things to do of how to find all your

assets and you could go through that

checklist think you found all the assets

think and move on but hopefully in this

course we never think done move on

because we always know we're not done so

this is just a starting point to make

sure you don't forget some stuff there's

not the ending point so how would you

find all the assets well if I was trying

to find relie assets I would ask all the

people in the organization or as many as

I could because again

control or another word for that I guess

there's defense-in-depth just try and

have lots of eyes looking at it and I

might forget something but there's a

chance there's a chance at me and person

B might forget it and a B and C might

forget it so that's good also different

people in different parts of the

organization will have a different view

on what the organization does and what's

important to it and you might just take

a whole lot of things for granted and

not realize there's all these important

assets there that need to be protected

so involve as many people as possible it

was just a couple of execs or security

people it gets together in a little

locked room by themselves not connected

to reality and comes up with a list of

what's important you've probably

overlooked a whole lot a really

important thing so get out there and ask

everyone inside multiple pairs of eyes

what kind of plan so just asking people

what are the assets although in theory

it sounds good and practice most people

will stare at you blankly it will just

tell you what they think you want to

know and so I actually have a strategy

to get the information from people

that's likely to work I suggest your

strategy should involve some sort of

feedback so you get a list in your shell

to either show it to people so they can

constantly comment on it because often

people when they see things they can

criticize them and spot problems in it

but giving a blank sheet of paper they

won't necessarily get anything on it so

do work out some sort of plan I would

say ah what we're going to do is we're

gonna consult with people for three

weeks and we'll get our glory what are

you doing that's a very nice tummy thing

so I talked to a whole lot of people I'd

say we're going to consult for three

weeks then we're going to produce an

interim plan and we're going to

circulate that and then I want you to

check with all your customers and your

clients on there and there'll be two

weeks of this and then but just somehow

actually work out this one process until

everyone what what you're going to be

doing and don't just invent it as you go

work out some sort of a checklist I'm

doing then when you've done it and

you're really feeling smoker you think

oh I've we've got all the assets of our

organisation that I have to protect like

for example I think I asked in the exam

on you

you're the newly appointed CSO chief

security officer for UNSW and you've got

a budget of X what are you going to

spend it on so

good answers versus bad answers bad

answers oh hey my random first thoughts

that I thought of I think coronavirus

and smallpox or this shiny object over

here and it doesn't matter how well

Lakes Florida virus smallpox with a

shiny object over there they're just

missing so many things so the good

answers did this they sat down and

articulated what all the assets were

that they were trying to protect I

didn't say the word I said in the

question I just said what are you gonna

do you got some budget how you gonna do

it and it's up to them to realize oh

this is a question where I need to

actually work out what I've got to

protect when they found all sorts of

really interesting assets and

interestingly Uranus that W itself has

gone through an asset strategy recently

trying to identify all its assets and

they may actually feel quite well and

did involve and consult with lots of

people and then produce lists in show

them to other people and things and so

on so the sort of doing it quite well um

but you can imagine what are the assets

of the Uni what do you guys think one of

the assets you have to protect

why doesn't everyone take one minute

provide a list of asthma now don't even

call him out just yet though

well done whoever did who was it was it

Michael not someone no Tom Tom well done

tom yeah everyone just grab a piece of

paper and write down five things see how

you go I mention it's an exam question

what are five things you want to protect

in the uni they'll be 100 so just pick

five important ones

you

okay twenty more seconds Clifford that's

an awesome picture Wow

okay look a really interesting thing I

can see your faces as they've got the

cameras turned on while you are thinking

and a friend of mine told me about this

and it seems to be quite true that

everyone has a characteristic thing they

do with their eyes when they're thinking

like when your your brains goes inside

itself and you'd sort of turn off

everything and whether they are

apparently and I don't know if this is

true whether your eyes goes to the left

or the right or up or down toes it tells

something about your brain he was saying

ah it tells you if you look Brenda right

behind us I don't know if it's true but

I can certainly notice that Tom your

eyes go in a completely different

direction to Gloria's partner who's

there muffled ah sorry

to be fair that's also because I'm

looking at a monitor that's next to my

screen Oh curses

sorry yeah that's alright that's alright

will you look at the monitor when you

were thinking that yes I was okay yeah

except your eyes I was writing down

where's the monitor yeah but your eyes

are going the other way is that not

possible you think you're looking at the

monitor the whole time I mean maybe for

some of it I wasn't maybe I was looking

back here I don't know all right

I could easily be wrong because you know

we just see what we want to see so Tom

what we what's one of yours well yeah

like I said the physical buildings is

one buildings that's a one good yeah the

physical buildings there with a lot of

money your money goes into building

those buildings FEMA what do you reckon

I said like intellectual property yeah

that's a really good one well done yeah

there's lots of ideas at the Uni someone

else want to say something money money

yeah the Uni has bank account so here

are qoodles in there

say again sorry I was gonna say is there

chemicals like in like this science

building like the chemistry lab oh yeah

they're like hazardous homes that could

be yeah maybe they have restrictions on

getting them oh yeah or you can do bad

things with them or something like that

yeah yeah that's a really good point

I've never heard that one before

that's a really good one communication

channels in general yeah the unit

ability the Uni is sort of an organism

that only exists when it's moving you

know it has a life independent of the

buildings and so if it lost its ability

to communicate that would be very

disruptive yeah yeah

reputation is huge I reckon my top three

would be reputation but it wouldn't be

number one so I put one finger up like

the number one would be the humans on

campus staff and students the safety of

the staffing students and number two

would probably be its reputation and

number three would be financial things

like money yeah it's easy to forget the

humans but an attack where you keep all

your money but loser humans or damaging

humans it's probably not worth it

I would think anyone would you would you

say in a situation right now where

you've got everyone sort of working off

of campus or majority of people working

off of campus then when you said humans

on campus having with would you show me

to protect them in that case as well

yeah I mean absolutely the I don't know

if they need to protect them but they

need to notice it's an asset what they

end up deciding to protect depends on

the cost of that protection and the

impact that has on the risk so if you

could spend a ridiculous amount of money

and just changing with slightly it's

probably not a good use of money but you

need to know your very top asset is you

your students so we should be getting

around to work safely we should be

encouraging people to do the right thing

all that sort of stuff and also our

reputation is so important if people

started thinking you know we were a joke

and not scholarly and not academic or

something like that that would be quite

a disaster

so so I would think for most

organizations protecting their people is

probably absolutely important to include

and their reputation and then their

financial assets then interesting side

assets people talking about the so here

are just some random examples I think I

told you the story already didn't I was

walking down the street someone said

I'll stick this syringe in your neck and

they should give me your wallet

try to use I think I did ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

and I didn't give them the wallet and I

got the syringe stack of money and

afterwards I thought well I protected

the wallet asset I just got to protect

my life as it and at the end of the day

probably that was not a sensible choice

to the card doorbell story my friend who

has this very expensive car used to park

it in gleep all the time people would

break into it all the time he thought it

was drug addicts trying to get stuff

that's specially come up and take stuff

out and he got so cross and annoyed that

people were breaking into his car all

the time that he wanted to put an alarm

on he's very clever man

so what he did was he but he's also very

stingy so we just got a remote doorbell

because dingdong when you push the

button and he flipped the switch around

so it ding donged when you release the

button I guess he had to probably swap

the type of switch and then he just put

that put that switch in the car inside

the door so when the door was shut up

push the switch in so soon as someone up

in the car went ding dong

if someone opened the car door inside

his house he put the thing inside his

house because he parked outside his

house and he was talking about how

clever it was and I was thinking no no

because what are you gonna do when the

dingdong goes off you got to go outside

and have a fight with drug-addicts

that's you know might protect your car

but the smartest person I know for

protecting cars the people used to smash

the car window to reach in to look for

loose change he had one of those little

triangle windows at the front they don't

have them anymore on cars now but they

used to be this little sort of side

window by the drive that was a little

triangular shape and you could punch

through it quite easily so people would

smash it and then just grab into the god

box and take a little room and he

protected that by leaving his window

open he said I don't care if they take

what's out of the glove box they're real

I said I'm trying to protect here is my

window because it would cost me 300

bucks to replace each time so he just

leave his window open as it was parked

at night the share registry yeah we've

gone to an electronic share registry no

more paper trials you might want to

think about what assets they're trying

to protect and what the risks are of

having a share Ridge streak online

coca-cola what are they trying to

protect the rest of us

well yeah you'd think it was their

recipe that's part of this very very

clever thing they've done apparently the

recipes widely known to lots of people

and you could reverse engine

from the ingredients I buy and there's

all these side channel leakages it's on

but you know the myth is that it's

locked in a safe and and and and only

one person is accommodation but they do

that to build to give value to the

recipe so you think oh it's special and

secret must be really good I think

they've done they've collected those

fMRI machines to people's brains and got

them to drink Coca Cola and drink Pepsi

and look at how their brain lights up

differently and when you drink coke one

part of your brain lights up really

excitedly when you drink Pepsi another

part does and you probably know the

story that if you ever do a blind test

on people they don't know if they're

drinking Coke or Pepsi they always

perform prefer Pepsi it tastes nicer but

if they know what when they're drinking

they always prefer Coke um and it turns

out that the center of your brain that

lit up it's associated with the pleasure

center when you drink coke would also

light up if you're drinking Pepsi and

someone told you it was coke

so it's essentially the brand your brain

is just programmed to respond to that

brand because of Al in marketing so

their brand is everything so an attack

on them where they look like dicks or

they didn't look cool you know that

would be a really effective attack so

that's what they're trying to protect an

attack on Parliament yeah what are the

assets of Parliament okay let's not talk

about that anymore so how do you value

the asset I reckon at least have this

checklist to go down but you probably

want to happen to the checklist and come

up with your own ones and you can search

online and certainly there's lots of

standards of ways that people suggest

that you should go around finding assets

and it's called the numerating the

assets so you got tangible assets you've

got intangible assets

you've got what have we got here

employee morale and security customer

information company secrets availability

of services that's a sort of

communication channel on someone's

talking about just your availability is

really important

then there's psychological and emotional

costs that you will incur if things go

wrong the point I wanted to say was just

because it's really difficult to value

intangible assets that doesn't mean

don't do it they're probably your most

important assets

you're just gonna do the best you can

it's really hard and you probably get

the number wrong but you should still

try

[Music]

Wow can you read all this how would you

assess the value of a park use something

how would you work at the value of a

Picasso painting what if it wasn't a

Picasso painting it was the same

painting but it was painted by someone

else it's very interesting to work out

how things are valued the science of

valuing things is really its arcane

there's at least three different methods

that are all equally plausible we use to

assign monetary values to things one is

how much someone else will pay for it so

that's simple and you can measure that

someone would give you $100 for it's

gotta be worth hundred dollars one is

how much you paid for it like the cost

basis and often people say ah don't

damage this it's worth seven hundred

bucks

and I think actually now it costs you

700 bucks it's not there's only were 700

bucks one is how much it would cost you

to replace it and these are off and one

is if it generates income for you the

present value of all the future income

flows that it's going to give to you and

these methods all give you different

numbers and maybe you can arbitrage

between them certainly if the income

stream you can get from it in the future

is a higher value than what other people

are prepared to buy or sell it at it's

worth buying but um Oh Tom you want

control of my screen why do you want

that I was just a syrup button there and

I was curious what would happen if I try

if I did it

alright I'm giving you control of my

screen I I want you to let me just find

the terminal and RM RF that's really

concerning

that's a hexagon sorry that we're on the

lek show I'm not gonna run the lecture

that seems like a really bad idea yeah

um but that's that's fun and you can't

like keep clicking on buttons that's a

good thing to do

just draw there you go you have control

again because that seems like a bad idea

to sort of distract the lecture I think

I set up the Preferences to be quite

lenient to let people do think oh thank

you

so yeah think about and there's a whole

lot of interesting stuff on art fraud so

we're talking about physical security

recently there's been a couple of art

frauds really recently - in fact a whole

lot of art that's up there now is

believed to have been faked and it's

really hard to know how to value that so

anyway think about valuing things I just

want to point out that it's a difficult

thing to do but you bloody gotta do it

because at the end of the day you've got

a small budget you've got to spend it

don't expend it on like that feeling or

a gut instinct do some sort of rational

calculation and think I'm gonna protect

that but I've also got to protect this

and I can't forget this is still worth

something and then allocate how much you

put on particular law based on the risk

in how much wealth and how we gain for

time while we're nearly there okay and

then hashes we did talk about hashes

before I was just going to do a tiny bit

of hash revisions you wanna do some hash

revision everyone just stop

[Music]

what are you wrecking you know Kiko ash

just do it for a few more minutes and

then we'll have our party so here's some

words that I've already said I said to

you already but in these notes here I'm

giving the terminology that I said in

the other lecture because I couldn't

learn how to light things so the hash of

X if you got a message X and you want to

hash it call the hash H of X so H of X

equals H of X - here what that's meaning

is the hash of one message called X is

the same as the hash of another message

called X - or X prime so that's a second

preimage resistance da-da-da-da-da

I think that's just explaining here's

the interesting points that we haven't

really talked about all right the

birthday attack I don't think I talked

about the birthday cake did I right I

think I would just talk about the

birthday attack now

I'm gonna make snide point first Bruce

Schneier and then I'm gonna with

the birthday attack and then we're done

Shania says basically you can hash

should behave like a random function so

you stick you put a message in you

should get something up that looks

random and you put a different message

in should get a different hash coming

out and it's this shouldn't look like

there's any link between the message and

the hash you should just be completely

random or look completely random the

question of randomness is really

interesting by the way that's one of my

obsessions because of course nothing's

ever random we do in computing we just

talked about pseudo random things that

look random and then you spend all your

time trying to distinguish them from

really rare but we can talk about

randomness another time and we should

because it's so interesting but the idea

is if I can prove that a hash function

isn't random or find some non randomness

to it that I'm essentially broken when

we break breaking a function breaking a

cryptographic function means you should

stop using it means it's weak now

breaking a function like either an

encryption

or hashing function technically we say

something's broken when you can do

something with it faster than you could

brute-force it so we know all almost

encryption algorithms can be brute

forced we haven't talked about one

one-time pads yet which can't and don't

let please don't then you forget this

but most encryption algorithms can be

brewed for us to either Briggs forces

the key or your brute force or possible

plaintext messages to see which

corresponds to the encryption message so

if it takes um if it if there's two to

the hundred possible keys on yeah let's

say two to 100 possible keys then the

amount of work to brute force it on

average if your brute forcing over all

possible keys would be two to the 99

because remember that's half of two to

the hundred because you've got one less

doubling so it's half the size because

on average you find it halfway through

and if that half thing didn't make sense

by the way just remember that all funny

riddle that we used to ask kindergarten

or primary school kids I've got our lily

pond and I've got one Lily on it and

every day it's Lily splits into two

Lily's in in one month the whole pond is

covered how long how many days did it

take till it was half covered

your god you think it's too hard but

you'll kick yourself

I know oh you didn't think it was hard

you were teasing me yeah it's one one

day less the day before because it's

doubling every day so the day before it

was just half full so if you just take

one day off that's half the size if you

double every day that's exponential

growth so if you two to the something is

exponential so two to the hundred half

of that is two to the 99 just take one

off one lot of two off so yeah on

average you'd so we'd say that you had

broken a Crip and a cypher if you which

you could brute-force in 100 bits of

work so on average 2009 if you can work

out a way of decrypting the message that

takes to less than 2 to the 99 bits of

work on average now that ciphers broken

now notice even if you only work out a

way of it taking 2 to the 98 which is

still a ridiculously big number so still

takes to the 98 bits of work it's still

better than brute force so it's broken

so we stop we want to stop using it in

it seems strict but because once it's

broken a little bit it just tells you

the whole thing's brittle and fragile

and fall into pieces

oh brittle and fragile reminds me

remember at the beginning I said when we

were talking about systems or properties

we want them to have what makes them

prone to error what makes them prone to

catastrophe what makes and prone to what

makes them prone to attack and I gave

you two of the properties and that was

coherence and coupling so I think one

thing we're seeing now with the whole

corona thing is an example of coupling

we have a tightly coupled system so one

thing going causes this ripple on effect

so you're probably noticing that with

the supply chain now if you lose well

you lose airplane travel and suddenly it

has this ripple on effect and suddenly

all these other things are affected you

probably started to notice that you're

trying to disentangle them

oh that stopped working that means this

stops working and Australia no longer

manufactures its own cars we just import

them from other countries so if we're

not getting stuff from other countries

we're not going to get cars anymore we

we we've coupled ourselves to other

countries

and all the other things we don't

manufacture anymore we're not going

again so that's an example of we had a

tightly coupled system and we all know

tightly coupled systems when they work

well who cares

doesn't matter if they're coupled or not

but if they if something goes wrong then

you get a chain reaction that the

coupling leads to a magnification and I

think the whole world also was drawing

all over a love heart that's so

beautiful

what's your name they're like four

people doing it that's fantastic

everyone should do it graffiti over is

so beautiful I have people taking photos

of this if I scroll up is it gonna ruin

it this is like the place did you ever

see the place Richard no I didn't should

I see the place it was it was like this

thing on reddit where you could post you

could basically put a pixel down on a

shared screen everyone could do it yeah

yeah we did that in 2011 I let students

get pixels in the course of oh go every

time you did something good you got a

pixel and then people started

collaborating by getting a pixel means

they could control a color of the pixel

that was on the course logo that was on

every page and then so people started

essentially graffiti on the course logo

and then people started colluding with

other people and all the high school

students doing hs1 no.17 colluded and

combined their points and changed the

name of the course to be high school

computing place bubbling all over it was

very exciting

and then we're also making lots of fun

Denmark and a lot of people colluded and

bought red and white pixels and work

during Denmark laser yes the place

fantastic I didn't know that's what it's

called was briefing um so anyway I think

I talked enough about that

oh no the birthday attack was what I was

gonna say so he's held the birthday

attack oh the point I was trying to make

then let me just finish it because I

can't remember if I did it's broken even

if in practice it doesn't look like it's

broken its broken even if you can break

it slightly faster than brute force even

if it's still infeasible to break it

like it there's no we're worried we

think that you've found one problem

suggest there's 50 more that we haven't

found

so walk away and I was going to talk

about the birthday attack we've only got

seconds left or negative seconds left so

here's what I'm gonna say about it it's

based on something called the birthday

paradox the only paradox about the

birthday paradox is it involves a word

paradox because it's not a paradox I

cannot understand why it's called that

and the birthday paradox might be

something you've done at school with a

teacher where everyone goes around the

room saying what their birthday is I

sometimes do it in the course and I'm

really ashamed to say that sometimes

people say their real birthday so please

never do that if someone asks you to

illustrate the birthday paradox was real

birthdays they're just trying to trick

you to get your birthday because we want

all your money so the idea is you ask

first person what their birthday is and

you ask the next one investor next one

the next one and after a ridiculously

short period of time you find two people

with the same birthday someone suddenly

says my birthday's this and you go but

that's the same as bride's birthday and

it happened so quickly and that's called

the birthday paradox I don't know why

people call that the paradox is it

happens much faster than you expect

naively sometimes people think well

surely it would take hundreds of

birthdays and so you gotta match but it

would take hundreds of birthdays until

you've got to match with a particular

birthday so I'd have to ask on average

half of 365 what's at 180 issue hungry

maybe two on average I'll have to ask

192 people their birthday before I found

someone who had the same birthday as me

so that would take a very large number

of people to ask but I have to ask many

less people to find just a pair of them

any old random pair that have the same

birthday because I've give are six

people when you ask the seventh person

this six birthdays they could get that

would find a match once you've asked 10

people the 11th person there's 10

birthdays they could say which would

give them a match so the chance of a

match increases quite quickly or

linearly but as you go from post as you

add more and more people so here's what

you need to know about the birthday

paradox there's only one important thing

to know about it it's only the only

piece of masking eaten on the course of

learning now if you've got n people

sorry if you've got n possible birthdays

so n for the real birthday paradox is

365

it takes on average the square root of n

people to ask until you get a collision

you get to the same thing so if we have

done a planet that had a year that was a

thousand days long so there was a

thousand possible birthdays it would

take the square root of a thousand

people on average to ask before we're

not people aliens on the planet that

you'd have to ask before you hit a match

and if they're only a hundred birthdays

in a year you'd only have to ask 10

people and on average you'd hit a match

so it's the square root and why do we

care about that because if we're

thinking about hash function is a random

function like tossing a coin every time

then the number of possible hash values

is the number of birthdays are so if

you've got a hundred bit hash value

there's two to the hundred possible hash

values so if you've got a hundred bit

hash value and you just hashed messages

randomly how long before you found two

messages in that group that had the same

hash till you hit a collision like the

birthday collision how many messages

would you have to hash till you found a

collision if you've got two to the

hundred possible ashes and the answer is

through to the hit husk a square root of

two to the hundred people you'd have to

do a square root of two to the hundred

hashes and how do you find the square

root if you've got powers you know how

to heart of you just subtract one I mean

two to their hundred is two to the 99

but what's the square root of two to the

hundred does someone want to say it's 2

to the 50 so if you've got a hash it's a

hundred bit hash someone can find a

collision in that hash carry out a

collision attack only doing two to the

fifty bits of work well only trying to

the 50 hashes now you might want to sit

down and work out how long it would take

to do two to the 50 bits of work but I'm

pretty sure you know straightaway that's

a feasible amount of work so if your

hash is only 101 people in a feasible

amount of time can find collisions they

can't easily find a pre-image they can

find a collision all right I think

that's all I wanted to say and I had

gone over by 5 minutes so

I'm really sorry stolen five minutes of

your life so nice to see you all we're

going to start the party in a second or

two but if you're not hanging on for the

party good luck to you all

I look forward to seeing you on Monday

and oh and here's an announcement the

Uni is about to send out I don't have to

have yet apparently all courses are

gonna switch to be marked it's just past

5:00

have you got an announcement saying that

can apparently oh not for the whole uni

sorry Louie is looking like she's

swallowed a frog because she's in law

now in engineering so apparently it

could be just gossip you know Trump

tweet but apparently this course is

going to have to just issue a pass/fail

mark so that's what we'll do but I tell

you what I'll still work out a merit

list or something at the top people and

I'll still work out numbers if anyone

wants them but an email will be going

out about this later

I presume yeah I assume so yeah this

isn't an official announcement for me

this is just an official passing on a

gossip but I've got to say just think

about how it'll affect the course I

think it should just relax you it means

everyone's gonna pass I know when does

anyone ever follow this course no one

ever does so you could just stop turning

up and doing any work whatsoever and you

still fine so hopefully it makes it

clear in your mind now why the heck am I

doing this cause what do I want to get

out of the course why am I here

hopefully you want to learn or some

stuff and become awesome so you've put a

lot of effort into the course trying to

understand it all but and develop

awesome skills but you don't have to do

it because someone's bullying you as

marks just do it because you want to if

you don't want to and don't but I hope

you do cuz it is fun alright so we're

gonna have a party in a second we're

gonna see uhm the spotless Bond film

Larry have you ever seen that film no

you haven't

oh wow maybe people haven't seen it's

quite an old film it's an awesome film

so I hope to watch it together the links

for doing it on the announcement I sent

around before

let's hope they all work if they don't

I'll post another announcement on hope

and learning when I notice no one turns

up and will take us a minute or two to

do it but anyway lovely to see you all

and I look forward to seeing you all

I hear oh I'll look at that you

scribbled over everything that is that's

my favorite screen ever I'm gonna take a

screenshot of that oh that's awesome

okay Sierra I'll leave the camera on in

case you leaving slowly don't feel you

have to go home I try and work out how

to take a screenshot there's a Save

button at the top oh is it but at least

on for me I can see a Save button

Oh okay when you when you click on

annotate it brings up like the options -

I think they're the option to annotate

you guys good oh I think I just I know

it so good

thank you run and love hearts that's a

good love hard to make for me you and I

home is someone drew Homer Simpson

that's fantastic and actually I've set

the movie up on the other laptop just

over here so I'm just gonna walk off

screen for a second and actually click

go over here so you're not connected to

the internet okay Internet Netflix party

all right

can people see it has anyone come here

someone post a note if you're here

already I said starting at 7 p.m.

chatroom I can't see any other notes

I hope it's kind of whoa

what I was saying now is anyone there

for money I'm coming back to the screen

is anyone there is anyone logged in give

me a thumbs up if it's working I can

only see the screen that's been

graffitied all over oh yeah you have to

go to Chrome Oh rat see you have to

click on that link that I sent you

before sure sure

it's not a zoom thing it's it's a Chrome

extension

so all that installs requires installing

Chrome so yeah I just had to do that

this afternoon but only takes a second

and you have to give Google of your

heart it it takes more than a second one

rating system unfortunately oh no I'm

really sorry I don't know what I can say

for the whole thing anyway alright you

should definitely watch it why don't you

watch it on Netflix anyway and we all

just start together yeah

that might work I never would have

jumped out of the coffee yeah I'm up if

you've actually got it working someone

how are you going Michael yeah I'm gonna

take off

Thanks see you next week yeah I like

your whiteboard thank you yes

you'd be productive if you had some

stuff on there alright see you next week

man see ya

I apparently can't leave the meeting

because it's still trying to let me draw

over stuff I don't know how to turn off

drawing over things so it's just I'm

gonna stop sharing how about there

that way all right we're going oh yeah

oh yeah people are here who people are

coming so I hope you can install crown

and come and join us for this fantastic

movie and shall I leave the camera on is

there any point in doing that no no okay

all right I'm gonna go I see you all run

it's made me very happy

see you is it girl how do I pronounce

your name go go go go around go around

go rob yeah Corral see you girl

okay thank you see ya even see Oliver

Andrew and N and Haran and Sean and iris

and sage in Nathan and tre and Chandler

and German so you have people around

cryptography so one solution was Roth

psyche we can communicate the secrets in

the clear but if you select one of them

and the bad guy can't know without

decrypting them all which one you pick

then there's a work factor difference

between us but as we saw before and you

might want to check the mess on let

yourself just work out how much time it

takes Ralf versus how much time it take

the adversary in the middle to crack it

for different number of puzzles what if

you've got ten puzzles Helens detect

Ralph how does it take the person in the

middle what if you've got a hundred

puzzles what if you got a thousand

puzzles but you go to medium puzzles how

many puzzles do you need if I don't know

we're communicating with someone how

much time can I put into finding the key

upfront

could I put a minute into it probably

not if I'm connecting to a webpage

probably want to find it in under a

minute time I mean we want that to be

almost instantaneous and if I'm

communicating the supplier I might even

be able to take ten minutes but suppose

you've got a window there are somewhere

between one second and ten minutes that

seemed out of time that one person can

decrypt a puzzle to set the whole thing

up then how many puzzles do we need to

send to keep an emissary away who's got

which one could be a part of us you

might want to do some counselling as

one's just to convince yourself that

although it's clever it's still not

exactly feasible doesn't exactly solve

our problem but what a good idea so with

the promise of Ralph's solution in mind

we can think and maybe this thing this

seems really difficult maybe there are

almost magical solutions if only we

looked hard enough and a whole lot of

people did in fact I think it was

someone at GA CQ or the NSA or something

like that some mathematician claims to

have discovered this method long before

the people in the clear discovered it

but you know they work for a secret

government organization that doesn't

share any information and doesn't

increase knowledge around the world that

wasn't helping a mathematician so tough

like you lost your credit doesn't matter

if you invented it you didn't share it

doesn't yeah so the first people that

found it and share it with everyone

were Rivest Shamir and Adleman Ron

Rivest Shamir

oh look listen a plane that's such to

race out the value of my house has gone

up quite a lot since therefore Ananias

came because there's life periods of

times now without clothes there's um

remission and Adelman

discovered or invented this really

clever idea here's how it goes what they

were thinking is instead of the bang

like a safe so I want to communicate

with Clifford I go and I think of the

cryptographic solution as being like a

combination say so I go up to the

combination safe and I unlock it and

then I put my letter to Clifford inside

and that's unlocking its I mean i unlock

it

put the letter inside then I lock that's

the equivalent of encrypting and then

Clifford it exact to the the safe and he

types of combination you know but it

takes a look at the same as decrypting

the shared secret here is the

combination to the safe

so this is a like sort of a physical

metaphor encryption

and the danger is how do we I get the

combination to him how do I look tough

they're all how many safes do I need if

I'm communicating with a million people

and we all need to be able to

communicate pairwise with each other

with you know half a million tons of

meaning sighs that's a 1/4 trillion site

so that's not feasible so but maybe we

can come up with another metaphor then

maybe you don't have to stick with the

safe idea and those algorithms by the

way called I think I mentioned last time

symmetric encryption algorithms because

the same key is used to unlock that safe

by cliff and me so if I know it the

secret I needed to encrypt then anyone

who knows that same secret can decrypt

anyone that opens a safe to put the

message you can also open the safe -

thank you Miss ajar so here's the other

idea what if everyone in the world has a

letter box that belongs to them and what

if it's locked with a key that only they

have that's the shape of the secret the

shape of the key and what if there's a

little slot liner and anyone can poke

something in but somehow physical magic

you can get things in through the slide

with you can pull things back out

through this one some had the world's

best fish trap so imagine that then if I

want to send a secret to Clifford

all I've got to do is know where he is

post boxes and I could drop it in and

then he uses his key to take it out I

don't need the key so even after I've

dropped it in I actually can't get it

out again once I've encrypted a message

I myself can't decode it so the power to

encode drop it in the letter box is

different to the power to teacher and

the nice thing about that now is key

management because how many keys do we

need well we need one per letter box you

got a million people

you don't need half a million times a

million keys you need by the way that's

an interesting piece of maths isn't it

if I've got a million people how come I

need half a million times a million keys

for everyone to have a differently for

everyone I can communicate with and

that's just a simple bit of maths but

let's just talk about it for better an

approximate number if all of those

million people can communicate with the

the rest of the million people then

every for every one of those people for

every person initiating the message you

need a million keys for a run or

receiving message

and then from the next person initiating

a message you need a million case full

of people receiving the messages and for

the next person you need another million

and for all the million people you need

a million keys so that gives us a

million times a million ah but we've

double counted because I need if we

would think again think you mean

Clifford and I don't mean to pick on

your entities if it was me and Clifford

then when you get to me in the first two

lists then one of them meaning please I

need this one for Clifford but then also

when you get to Clifford in the first at

least one in a million case he needs is

one for me so we've counted that twice

so we divided by two so that's half it's

a big number but with the letterbox Ally

we just need a minion letterbox

so the number of please we need scales

linearly and the number of keys any

person needs to keep track of instead of

main heading to keep track of all a

million cases that relate to all the

people I speak to and let's be really

clear I could speak to more than a

million people it's more than a million

into address of the things on the

Internet there's many many because in

order several lots of orders of

magnitude more than a million things I

could talk to on the Internet

so actually a million meaning case is

not enough so yeah I only need to keep

track of one key round the meeting case

for my own personal use so that's all

now sounding really convenient so how

would we come up the cryptographic

implementation of this letterbox ID

well Rivest Shamir and Adleman came up

with it and they named it after

themselves and it's called RI and

several other ones have come since but

RSA is the simplest and it's quite

beautiful so that's the one we're going

to teach you in if you've done any

cryptography before million other

courses you probably sometimes people

have learnt it four or five times in

other courses because it's so beautiful

that as soon as a lecturer has a spare

10 minutes elf and just teaching RSA

because it is quite lovely

so sorry if you've learnt it lots and

lots of times if you haven't learnt it

at all I suggest you look it up a little

bit and find out a bit more about how it

works because it is beautiful but here's

the basic idea and I'm going to do this

using high technology

mr. squiggly so um he's the magic piece

of algebra you need to know he can't

watch me writing but I'm holding up an

opinion a to the B what's this

I a to the B to the power of C what to

two to the three of the power of two

I'm trying to look at what it is

hopefully you've worked out that 2 to

the 3 is 8 because we do the thing

inside the brackets first and so the

power of 2 means we squared x squared 64

so the answer is and what's this 3 to

the 2

oh no 2 to the 2 to the power of 3 I'm

gonna swap the outside two ones around

and I'm gonna scribble all over it to

make it more confusing so you see I swap

the reversing two and three around so

what's that well 2 to the 2 is 4 what's

4 to the power of 3 well 4 times 4 times

4 16 times 4 it's 64 lo and behold 2 to

the 3 to the 2 is the same as 2 to the 2

to the 3 try saying that quickly and

impress people so it turns out in

general this is true and you probably

learnt this in year 10 and you can see

why if you actually draw the damn thing

out if you actually um I think I should

do that now maybe someone else wants to

do that or I'll stick a picture of it up

but if you actually draw it down saying

2 to the 3 means 2 times 2 times 2 and

squared means you multiply that by 2

times 2 times 2 again and then you do

the same thing to two squares 2 times 2

and then you do that 3 times 2 times 2

times 2 times so you'll end up with 6

lots of 2 times 2

they see you're laughing in the

background it's it's I'm really jealous

because we're doing multiplication and

you're having fun so in eight to the

beach at C equals a to the C for the V

that's it these two things are the same

that's really the main thing you've got

to know well which finger am I using

this is the same as that here we go

so here's the idea oh I've better hold

it up a people bicycle tour um the idea

is is if your message think of it as a

number now how can we think of a message

isn't unwell

well if you're a computer scientist

that's not hard to do because the

message is just written in ASCII it's a

whole lot of bits that's a massive

number to the power of two's that's so

we we just think of computers express

everything as numbers as a whole

sequence of bits so an enormous sentence

is just a massively big number in binary

we all know that but two non

mathematicians it might seem weird but

just believe us you can assign to every

message a number in the same way naively

you could do it like this you could say

are the letter a is worth 1 and the

letter B is worth 2 and the lettuce is

worth 3 and so on as one's lights on so

a number between 1 and 26 will give me

one letter and then what if I then write

down another number between 1 and 26 and

put it next to it so look for example do

this because suddenly it's exciting I've

worked out a new encoding method that we

should paint the thirties like the 20th

Lilith T so 20 let's just say this th e

as 20 and a cheese baby cd8 and he is 5

so I could just write it down like this

oh these numbers backwards or can you

see them right way around comes up with

every one thumbs it down I wonder if my

screens upside down XP cuz you break

good

apparently there's people stuck outside

the lady what's that sorry Clifford

I'll check the chart I check the chain

yeah Richard hi it's Lisa

I'm gonna just jump in and let people

into the meeting so hopefully it doesn't

disrupt everyone that's already on there

but I'm gonna try that now oh yeah I

wonder how we let it run and manage

participants yeah should we let them in

let's take a vote man oh man except

you're upside down okay we're gonna have

a race Lisa to see who can work it out

I can't work it out oh yes I can how do

I do this Oh Julia it runs in oh my mom

then what more do you people keep coming

um now I have to say something that in a

minute or two I'm gonna have to suddenly

race away so I want to give you a puzzle

to do while I race away I have to race

away just for ten minutes because I

couldn't do an ABC interview and this is

the only time they can do it so that's

completely crazy and if you actually OBC

at the same time that'll be very

distracting so here's a puzzle for you

what I want you to do is I want you to

look up some things you can see them in

the lecture notes if you want to go

there but I want you to look up to card

monte and there's a particular one I

want you to see that I'll put a link to

I think it's called two card monte

reveal I want you to play that magic

trick but then stop it before the guy

reveals how he does it and see if you

can work it out and keep rewinding and

watching - you do it and then I want you

to look up three-card Monte which is the

find the lady the famous thing that

terry pratchett different talks about so

famous trick look up three-card Monte

because that is so beautiful the

three-card Monte says the ball upon the

way the whole time is on what people

want to come in this is very annoying

should just let it run you automatically

I guess with its Australia is now um so

oh yeah the last one I want you to look

up is this the white van scam has anyone

ever been scammed by the white van scam

normally there's at least one student

that's been caught by so the white van

or sometimes it's called the white band

speaker scam so could you look up those

three things and for those who've just

joined hello welcome

I'm just about to disappear for ten

minutes and you've got an exercise to do

for ten minutes which is look out -

crowd moans you reveal there's a couple

of different - card Monte's but I've

given a link to the good video that

doesn't give it away too soon as

actually a couple of different tricks

called it but watch it but don't

whatever you do don't let it watch -

roll too far other guy will explain how

he does it I want you to work it out

because I think with your brain it's a

very simple trick to work out there's

nothing fancy going on just with logic

you can work that one out three-card

Monte no one can work out that so

awesome so what's that and working

outwards and they look up to my pants

can does anyone understand the homework

yes yes yes yes or just sit there and

look at pictures of cats and pretend

you've done it because I can tell but I

think you should do it okay and I'll be

back in I think the interview starts in

five minutes they'll call me in one

minute and it'll they promise it'll only

go for five minutes so I'll be back

probably when the beak ends on the seven

at the Braille itis when the begins on

the height okay I'll see you soon

is anybody talking yet or am I just

okay

so there are people that are connected

to voice no worries we're all just

waiting for Richard to get that of

course I take over the lecture Chris I

don't know the content for this week

sadly sorry Chris just improv yeah no I

thought you had a question there my

question is how well can you do this

lecture improv

please don't paid him my headset DC the

real question is what rank are you oh

here we go

so in this entire lecture on me

it's an apron full duration it is

Halloween me you with ABC actually

pranking us for that I wouldn't put a

posture change he's probably having

dinner that's a real girl yes if you

scroll up through the chat there is a

tossed the gonna do what's the tune

called Monty video but yeah we're just

meaning right now comes grow up because

I only got let in quite recently

yes I'm can you repost the link a Google

to Todd Monty but then all of them were

like tutorial videos where it just

starts with showing you how the trick is

done without actually doing the trick

how to defeat the purpose of the I think

it's the first one is like the first few

seconds is one of them is Rick Astley

I'm sure of it well two of the links are

the same one of them pointed it's on a

loom so am i one or two people have

ruined it for everyone

yeah it's a good idea Charmin somebody

got me in their job apps last year

actually a lot of people got me in their

job apps last year they put evidence as

the Rick roll video I'm pretty sure you

mentioned that during a previous two but

yeah I'm shouting it out now so if

anyone wants to get anything shooters

that aren't listening please do well

you'll get zero for your job out then

because I do need some evidence oh I'll

make it redirect multiple tabs okay it's

not a thing you can do with HTML you can

do it with JavaScript you don't swear in

my presence please javascript is the

language of the world

thank you web browsers which programming

language do you back then Chris all

right you're not writing an assembly not

a real program wait you mean you don't

good strap your own computer no I'm I

back the one that is back out now while

you still can if you use rust hundred

percent safe yeah thanks Benny program

errors so where's marks on to come and

plug like Vijay s or something I'll see

if I can get any more no no no that's

not my intention that was not what I

meant

you don't use view and firebase you are

so fundamentally wrong you are just

objectively incredible hey Lisa is there

a cap to how many people can join a zoom

meeting

look the tutors Richard and the tutors

have the Pro Edition that we've been up

to upgrade through UNSW so if you just

have the free I yes there is a cap of it

right up to 300 but the free version

you're also limited to 40 minutes okay

yeah I'm just making sure that like

everyone can actually join the lectures

I wasn't sure oh yeah yeah no we've

definitely got enough room there was

Lachlan and I were discussing that we've

got AB and Richard from setting up his

own link because something was tipped

that meant everyone had to sit in the

waiting room before trial so we'll make

sure that's off if you can all Richard

doesn't do it very much like Richard yes

please

so I'm just having a look at zoom now

zoom pros a hundred participants doing

business is 300 participants so

hopefully it's a business plan because

yeah I am seeing that 99 participants

and it's a very worrying number but in

past lectures we have gone past a

hundred there's been like 115 yes but we

all have to wait for so long to getting

I think somebody has to approve that

yeah we'll definitely fix that the next

time that we won't have that waiting

that was a mistake for tonight ah

straight very nice xkcd I haven't

actually seen that one before is now the

time to plug the lecture for the

extended lecture definitely always um

just for those of you who are in

extended or want to come for the live

demonstration I'm doing the wireless

hacking tomorrow at during my tutorial

so it'll be at 6 o'clock so 6:00 until

6:30 ish will be me showing off how to

do how to break into wpa2 networks and

wireless enterprise networks so if you

want to come down you've got any

questions and that sort of thing please

just join the two meeting in the open

learning pages where all the tutorials

are posted it will be recorded for those

of you who do want to see it later or

don't have the time or whatever else but

the more the merrier I'd like a lot of

people there so that if there are any

questions somebody's there to ask it

Richards on the ABC right now

can somebody pull up the ABC livestream

is there a thank you hold on Sarah

surprised arrived

and in translation Lisa could screen

share the live stream I tried to screen

share but it's not working I'm locked

out of it only the hosting screen

try sharing the screen again see if it

works now yeah who's on it yes we

my man the myth the legend

while we're killing time does anyone

have any admin related questions that I

can help out with

is there something awesome during week 8

or week 9 something awesomes

do in week 9 we will have to put out a

communication about that let's do

question okay awesome thanks Tracy

that's you yes in your tube in week 9

how's that going to happen is ooh oh

yeah it'll be over zone in your tube

drink'll cool looking at sprays question

phrase questions in chat is their

extended tonight no there's no live

extended Lexington like Chris back me up

on this into your lecture you'll be

releasing a recording of the lecture yes

so if you want to join in and see the

live lecture it's gonna be the wildest

hacking so that'll be on at 6 o'clock

tomorrow nights during my tutorial

sessions so if you go to the extended

drop down for open learning where all

the tutorial links for Zuma posted just

join that it will be recorded after that

and it will be put up either Thursday

night or Friday morning for you guys to

watch if you can't make it

hey Chris yeah if I had mailing you a

suspicious-looking USB can you plug it

into your laptop for my something

awesome what's the Politis way to say no

with regrets yeah no I do not have a

burner laptop lying around but I can

just go plugging USBs into especially

ones that I know are malicious from you

trust me this thing looks menacing

try adjusting your second question there

will be weekly activities they will be

released either Wednesday or Thursday

I'm not sure yet they will be stuff that

you can do from home relatively easily

Chris do want to add anything more on

that all no I haven't done them yet I'm

sorry okay we will get them done in the

next 24 hours yep no weld on our site

robert marcum criteria keep asking no we

haven't put it out we need to get that

out this week we are terrible and I'm so

so sorry

and hopefully Richard will join in and

we can all ask him together he just

signed off so I think now don't forget

to give him a clap a favorited let me

just get this working sorry I was just

on hold and then something went wrong

and err be saying I legis Livni waiting

it which is fine good work

we watched the whole thing let me just

check this is actually working

what can I hear anyone hello well me can

you hear me we can hear you

give me one more second

looks like it's working and that looks

like it's working this isn't working

are you there they wouldn't let me

stalking you on the speakers oh that's

what's going on change your output

device yeah I did change your output

device the problem is there are several

several different places where you can

change the output device yeah I can hear

you we can hear you

yeah not either overall settings are in

the zoom settings does anyone know we're

all right the few current that is me how

are you not bad

I've already plugged my lecture for

tomorrow so I don't need to do that

again

ah fantastic yeah everyone should

definitely say it definitely say did you

also tell the run about your great my

deal Richard my what circle yeah um

yes sorry someone said something which

if you click the arrow next to the mute

on the microphone go to audio settings

you should be able to change your oh you

legend who sang this very nice Mickey

Mickey

thank you I should have recognized your

voice

hello

and we have to take our way color you

know I can't hear you make sure you're

not muted

on that Nexus the Aaron action mute icon

should also have microphone settings and

then speaker settings as well where you

can select the input and your output now

it has a mute switch I'd the hardware

meter well found though I hope while I

was away did everyone get to look at to

account Monty what did you did anyone

work it out don't give it away for those

that haven't worked it out but who

managed to work it out I did you did

yeah yeah wow that's really impressive I

watched it like about 50 times before I

eventually got it a demo wasn't gonna

watch the end but it sounds like you got

it 50 times

- quite a long time um that's really

impressive so everyone do try and get it

three-card Monte are you amazed by that

three-card Monte for me is the ultimate

scam it's really beautiful it's perfect

misdirection because what you think the

truth isn't even the trick and the whole

time you're trying to work out how the

trick works it's a different trick it's

a trick insider trick it's very very

very very clever and last of all the

white band scam has anyone heard of or

encountered that before

the white van speaker scam so a couple

of years ago would have been a decade

ago now I did it with I was talking

about it and one student said oh man

that just happened to me last week or

something so there's someone missed

rally are doing the white van speaker

scam so it has been around for a long

time I haven't googled this year to see

if it's still active but I bet someone

somewhere is still doing it so beautiful

scam um so if you know about those three

scams that would make me very happy

all right let's get back to the lecture

notes I'll just go to shoes

[Music]

yeah I was a great interview by the way

oh you heard the interview at the same

time as I was giving it you watch the

interview but everything I do livestream

yeah what do you reckon did I say

anything stupid I always always say

something stupid and afterward like

myself but I was so flustered thinking

of you guys sitting there waiting I

can't even notice the stupid

I really like the to generation thing I

hadn't heard that before but it makes

sense yeah yeah that's right

it's a spot-on Chris if somehow got a

workout what the blockers are whenever

you're doing something and then think of

lateral ways of solving it and all this

is a son zoo thing one way of solving it

is working at the laboratories have not

annoying your parents but a better way

of solving it is well don't have you do

it then

so yeah just just chain reframe the

whole game it's a bit like three-card

Monte alright here we are I'm going

through the things oh sorry I'll tell

zoom to mirror my screen so you can see

what I'm doing and that presumably

today's things make sense desktop

desktop desktop desktop desktop Chrome

here we go sharing in crime let me know

if you can see it hope you can said all

good yeah that's it yep oh great

um so let's go guys and I've lost you

I've lost pictures of you oh okay don't

worry I won't be too ambitious and so

I'm just going to useful links but your

notes slide

yeah

all right asymmetric encryption so I've

talked about the general idea of it and

I mentioned the whole thing about ADA

the power of B to the power of C is the

same as a to the power of C to the power

of B and they're both equal to a to the

power of and here's where it's bad to be

doing it by words I really need to get

someone to like a photo of me saying

this and send it to you it's the same as

a to the in brackets B times C and

because now you can imagine it B times C

is the same as B times a so you can see

why the two things are the same so

anyway here's the idea I am gonna have

to go back to a picture of me can you

see me at the same time as this or can

you only see the screen we can see you

in the corner okay you are good all

right I'm gonna hold the thing up again

is that clear enough can you see that

there's a button top right to swap

between the screen share and the speaker

guys maybe you cannot click on the

person remote control is that it screen

mode which brings up both side by side I

had that working before thanks whoever

saying that and working before and I

have set up an extra monitor so I would

do that but somehow it drops out of your

screen man sometimes I put it back I

think I noticed if I went to preferences

and turned it off and on again and then

it worked all of a sudden let me try

that out official thing

where is it does anyone remember where

that setting is it tells it to you here

yeah jewel monitors turn it off turn it

on now it's a beard again thank you you

there I can see you and I can see what

I'm holding up all right good okay so

eight times P times C I just wanted to

just quickly explain the important thing

which is we're thinking of a message as

a number for example the word here you

could think of it as the number remember

we wrote the 24 the T and O for oh wait

for the h and the Oh five four they so

that's just a syntactic change or

replacement but you can see now you

could think of it as the number 20 what

two hundred thousand eight hundred and

five two hundred thousand eight hundred

and five in Richard encoding is the word

though so obviously it's not a very

efficient encoding there's a whole lot

of codes that don't correspond to

numbers or letters or anything but but

you can see you could turn any string

any sentence any message into a number

this way so once we've got a number then

we can do maths on the number now here's

the clever idea

all the crypto we've seen so far

involves taking a message and then

jumbling it permuting it and transposing

it I mean that's jump link sorry it's

not end and also substituting so

changing things when I see this I swap

with that when I say this I swap with

that when I say this yes what turn into

that so I turn I into Zed and beam to Y

or I turn this pair of letters into that

pair of letters or whatever so

substitutions transpositions and then

just complicated ways of doing that

really all the traditional cycles we've

seen but there's this new class of

ciphers that we're looking at now the

asymmetric ones and they use a different

idea which is rather than getting chaos

by just doing lots of jumbling

complicated things

let's get chaos from the land of

mathematics because some things in maths

are just chaotic like the distribution

of the primes the digits of pi there's

you know the operation the Mandelbrot

set there's all this beautiful structure

and mathematics that seems to have

randomness in it to the extent that we

don't understand it

like randomness to us that's sort of the

definition of randomness I guess so if

we can use the randomness in the

confusion that's in math to do our in

ciphering then we can actually possibly

even start saying more assertive things

like how hard it is to crack something

if if for example here's a clever thing

if you could somehow come up with a

cipher that's based on a famous problem

in maths that people have been trying to

solve for a long time and if you could

set it up in such a way that is cracking

a message decoding a message without the

key is equivalent to solving this really

hard problem in maths then you've got

some confidence that the thing can't be

crack because mathematicians have been

trying to crack this hard problem for a

long time they haven't been able to

what's the chance of some kid or a

computer science you know busy stress

you know cyber hacker or something like

that being able to beat all the top

mathematicians in the world that really

do nothing is very sad but yeah what's

Anna never say never say never of course

that's right in the land of security

it's only a matter of time

all we buy ourselves is time but if we

type exactly right yep that's right it's

the theory behind all of the essentially

all the asymmetric encryption algorithms

rely on this same thing that to solve it

you need to solve a hard problem now no

one's fully ever managed to get it set

up so they can prove that the only way

of solving it is solving the hard

problem so maybe it's possible to solve

it to crack the code without solving the

hard mathematical problem we've unput it

and the other way that if you can solve

the hard mathematical problem you can

crack it but we haven't managed to prove

that if you can crack it you can solve

the hard mathematical problem and if we

can go the other way then we'd have

assurance about how hard it was yeah

someone was asking regarding one-time

pads if you encrypted a message with a

one-time pad and you changed a single

character and encrypted a different

message is that sufficiently secure or

would that be on susceptible it all

right I know so I should be really clear

here I haven't told anyone about one

pipe heads except occasionally

mentioning how awesome they are

can't wait till we teach you and maybe

we should do that right now is that a

good thing to do Mickey and then answer

your question that's fine with me that

was just it there was an activity on

one-time pads a couple of weeks ago and

I was just wondering okay so we run

knows one that's already okay yeah so

though just for those that haven't yet

done all the activities let me give you

a summary the a one-time pad is a

substitution cipher so it's where you

change this letter into letter but the

key is the same size as the message this

is much information in the key as it is

in the message you've got that really

nice property then that gives you also

it allows you that establish all sorts

all sorts of other properties hold which

require that property having that

property isn't enough but that property

is essential to have to get these other

nice properties and the other nice

properties essentially relate to being

uncrackable

so how one time pad works is this letter

of your message and you you add a random

number between one hundred and six to it

say three you move three on in the

letters and then the next mother at a

random number maybe it's 20 see move 20

on in the letters and if you get to Z

just right background too high and keep

going and for every letter in the

message you have a different I mean you

just generate random numbers for each

for each one and then as long as the

person at the other end doesn't know and

you need as many random numbers

obviously as you have letters in the

message so the key the random numbers is

as long as message as long as the other

person at the other end knows that

sequence of random numbers they can

decode the message but the nice thing

about it is no one else can because that

misses looks exactly could plausibly

decode to any other message of the same

length with just a different key there's

there's no redundancy in it at all

there's no compression going on here at

all so you can't suddenly go woohoo I've

cracked it like you can within year and

when you cracked it you know you've

cracked it because the chance that some

other key would let you crack and get

every get meaningful English words is

almost zero I mean so close to zero it's

nothing but with a one-time pad yeah any

message of any length can be decoded to

any other message of the same length

so it's a very beautiful strategy

inspires use it a lot but the problem is

they have to carry around with them

pad with all the random numbers written

on it and back at the factory at the

headquarters control headquarters and

they make two copies of every pad and

then the people sending it go through

the pad getting the render numbers and

the people receive it go through their

company the pad getting the random

numbers they cross them out as they go

and you better make sure you don't move

out of sync and and then when you finish

using the numbers you eat the piece of

paper or burn it or something like that

and that is an uncrackable method the

problem is you need a lot of random

numbers Stuart you've got a big key

problem here so when your spies go

overseas they take a big book of random

numbers with them I've often thought

YouTube videos would be a great way of

transmitting blocks of random numbers by

the way because you know a good video or

something that's really well compressed

does look like a whole lot of random

bits and it would be accessible from the

other side of the world so the spy could

just log in and look at the same thing

you're looking at and you get gigabytes

of random bits as long as that you are

seeing exactly the same thing that might

be a way of distributing keys code books

but anyway the problem with one-time

pads is if you don't use them one time

if you use that same pad again even just

using it twice it's a bit like

reassembling shredded paper and things

for the people who put Brooklyn

nine-nine thing up that was very funny

um about paper shredding but yeah if you

have if you reuse the one-time pad on

two different messages then now there's

enough in there's enough non-randomness

in there that codebreakers can start to

break it and there are a famous examples

of that happening during the war i think

was the germans and maybe as a russians

ran out of code books instead of reusing

them using reusing books had already

issued because generating random numbers

is a bit hard and then how they do it is

they generate them and type them on a

typewriter with a sheet of carbon paper

so that you can make the two books so

why not put four sheets in and you can

make twice as you can make books twice

as fast making duplicate books but

unfortunately that was a terrible

weakness and a lot of those messages

have never been cracked after the war in

fact there's an ongoing project to crack

a lot of those messages sent in the war

with one-time pads where we know they

used to pickets um so anyway making your

question was what my question was if you

encrypt a message with a key and you

change one character in that key is that

sufficiently different to encrypt

another message

no you need to change the whole key you

need to change the whole key but if

we're talking pure randomness there is a

chance that would be another key oh yeah

but the chance is very low so if you'd

done that if I didn't know you've done

that yeah but I'd be I bet that's what

I'd be looking for I'd be looking for

similar keys

that's the unavailable so I'd be trying

and so you're just unlucky yeah yeah two

random ones picked the chance of the

numbers coinciding is very very low if

you read the random numbers out in

binary then for any pair of

corresponding bits there's only a 50/50

there's a 50-50 chance they'll match and

a 50-50 chance they'll be different so

you'll get lots of matching bits on

average half of them will match and half

of them will be different but if they're

clustered in some way then the

cryptanalyst going to make you something

cool okay so anyway that whole divergent

which was I hope interesting to you was

just saying one way of encoding is just

doing complicated stuff and say ah man

that's so complicated no one could ever

put that back together ah so he's an

example of that and this is an example

from Bruce Schneier who I really love

you write that book applied cryptography

that I think I could tell anyone to look

at wonder if I have a copy here hold

them up to you excitedly but um he's

he's one way of sending a message you

write the message on the back of a plate

you get a like a porcelain plate a big

ceramic plate you write the message with

a waterproof marker like this on the

back of the plane you put the plate in a

sack

and then you smash it with a hammer into

lots of tiny little pieces yeah almost

impossible if the bad guys intercept the

sack for them to reassemble the plate

out of the pictures so it's essentially

uncrackable oh that's a bit of a partner

excess now so since I took my place and

it's essentially an uncrackable but

what's the problem with that cipher

rollin what do you reckon

it's uncrackable but also very difficult

to reverse yeah oh I discovered a trick

by the way I don't know if it works for

you guys if you hold the spacebar down

you're temporarily unmuted yeah that's

right it's hard for a bad guy to crack

the code but it's also hard for the

intended recipient to read the message

to decode it so what we always want in

is we won't have something that's

sometimes called a trapdoor one have

some way of yeah it's really hard to

decode except if you know something

there's a trapdoor that lets you decode

a fast and then you make sure that the

recipient knows it all

so why number one is jumbling things way

number two is using the randomness in

maths and asymmetric cryptography

algorithms used maths and that is really

beautiful so the famous one RSA you just

uses the fact that a to the power of b

or used a couple of other next to a to

the power of B to the power of C is the

same as a to the power of C to the power

of B so again holding it up just to make

it really clear if my message is a the

number a is a message you see like it's

like this number huh it's like this

number here so write your message turn

it into a number and then raise it to

some power as my finger going yeah

that's encoding the message and then to

decode it raise that which is a to the C

and in it again raise that to the B and

then you go back to the beginning oh

sorry that's what you want to happen

yeah that's how RSA works it's not clear

that that will happen yet but that's

what you want to happen now the problem

if you raise one number to another

number is it gets much much bigger and

in terms of the number of digits the

number of digits increases so if you

square something the number of digits in

the outputs probably twice as big as the

number of digits in the input it's no

use having a cipher that your cipher

texts are massively bigger than your

plain text but in maths we can do this

thing called modding and modding means

you you divide by something and you only

look at the remainder so let me do some

examples of mods

pose we're going to take mod 10 sir

means divided by 10 and look at the

remainder

what's mod what's mod 10 of 17 7 Devin

what's mod 10 of 52 what's mod 10 of 9

million eight hundred and twenty six six

six yeah yeah yeah it just scripts the

last digit off at the main graph key

provider is the last digit now now so

mod 10 is really easy to do because the

way we've for us because the way we'd

write numbers down in base 10 the

remainder is actually the last digit but

if we were morning by 13 it'd be more

complex so what's 15 modded by 13 - yeah

yeah 15 is 2 more than a multiple of 13

a multiple of 13 being 13 what about 30

not 34 yeah yeah yeah because 26 which

is 2 times 13 is 4 less it's four more

than that so when you divide by 13

you've got a bit left over how I try to

explain it to my children when I

explained our I said to them and Noah

when they were like three and four was I

say okay we've got a bag of lollies

we're going to distribute between the

three of you guys we've got ten lollies

how many are left man they could work

that out straightaway there's one left

so 10 mod 3 is one I'd say okay what if

we had a party and like you had 10

pizzas 12 people at your party and we

had a hundred lollies is that enough or

is it going to be some left

and they try and work it out and I can't

I should be able to work it out what is

it 12 we've got 60s maybe 14 36 so it's

4 what must be 96 must be a multiple of

12 so there's four left and they would

get out pretty fast because if you think

of lollies and sharing and the

unfairness of having leftovers then

human intuition jumps in super good so

that's what modding is modding is you

divide by something and you look at the

remainder and the nice thing about it is

if I said to you to speak in a random

number well I did before I picked a

hundred I said a hundred mod twelve what

is it well essentially the output sort

of random I mean if it's the last digit

you can predict what it is but if I just

picked a random number and said I'm mod

17 what's 526 mod 17 but no idea it

could be any number between 0 and 16 was

sort of equal likelihood so it sort of

distributes around quite nicely so

that's what we do with our codes we

raise it we take our base message our

number we raise it to a power we get a

really big power and then we modify

something and we look at the remainder

only and that's a smaller thing and that

keeps a message back to the can we make

it through the same size as the original

message

okay so RSA is really clever and how RSA

works is you work out a pair of keys

which are each numbers and you work them

out so that any message raised to the

first number and modern by something and

say some number that you tell everyone

if you then raise it to the second power

you get the original message back that's

right so I send you a message by modding

it by one of the numbers and you decoded

by modding it with the other number

raising to the power of the other number

and they're modern so he's how it works

in practice one person works out the

pair of numbers using some special

secrets that trapdoor ething one person

works at the pair of numbers they tell

everyone one of the numbers but they

don't tell anyone the other number and

you can never work out the other number

where no one's worked out a fast way of

working out the other number from one

number you had to generate them both

together if I just give you one of them

are the other ones so everyone in the

world knows one of them and they use

that to encrypt a message and send it to

you and that's like putting it in the

letterbox and then I know the other

number that's like having the key to

letterbox I

can decrypt it so the number I tell

everyone I call my public key and the

number I keep to myself I call my

private key I never tell anyone in the

world my private key I tell everyone in

the world my public key anyone who wants

can send me a message encrypting it with

the public key

I can't decrypt it again once they've

done it no one can decrypt it except me

because I'm the only person that knows

the property and that is the idea of

asymmetric encryption me for encrypting

is different to the K from

decrypting and have you heard of the

phrase public key before in private key

yes okay that was a long way to the keys

work in both directions

yes thank ease dude that's Mickey I

recognize your voice uh-huh

because ie to the B to the C famous a to

the C to the baby so we don't encrypt

with the decrypt you can decrypt with

the N Kripke

from what I've seen the private key is

always significant longer than the

private key suppose your public key so

so the parent keys are generated upfront

and you can pick which pair you get or

you can pick one of them and then the

other ones determined and normally you

make one of them quite fast to do and

the other ones slow to do and I can't

remember which is a fast one I think

normally the public keys the first one

is X Y or observation if it's short a

kilo would assume that's faster yes what

a Keys faster basically raising

something to a power because you're

raising it to the power of the key if

you raise it to a smaller number it's

faster now then there is a fast way of

raising things to a power so that way

you know fast exponentiation yes it's

very beautiful isn't it okay yeah um so

basically it's just the number of ones

in the binary representation it doesn't

have to be sure seventeen for example so

not a bad example of okay it's probably

got cryptographic weaknesses that I

don't know that's way too small but um

but seventeen is 16 plus one so it's

only got two bits in its representation

so it turns out that's quite fast but

that's just for pragmatics the theory

works for is it possible to derive the

public key easier

the private key than it is the other way

around no their each is easy to derive

from the other as they are from the

other okay so you can release either key

you can release either one that's right

you generate this pair you call

arbitrarily you call one of them the

public and one the private that's right

so hypothetically if the public key is

faster to compute you could release the

private key keeping the public key

secret yet and you move the workload to

the client yeah yeah you're sounding a

bit like some multinational corporations

I know I mean you just got to work out

how you're gonna do it yeah that's right

whatever zelf normal solution that's

right

absolutely so our people are scribbling

all over are you guys are legends that's

fantastic but I'm not gonna talk about

this anymore I think I've talked enough

about public key cryptography now that

you get the idea is that right does

everyone get the idea yes not if you

know you're sort of not quite in oh sure

um what if we I might give you some

simple examples you can fool around with

what do you think of that just so you

can practice a rigid is what I wrote on

your screen correct X to the N mod said

equals B B to the M mod said is that

what you're trying to describe I got

myself confused so I'm just trying to

figure out if I'm correctly yeah m and r

is like n and m at the public and

private keys that's right and B is the

ciphertext and X is the plaintext and is

it the same set and it's the same thing

that's okay

fantastic thank you and that's because

of some problems of abstract algebra the

properties that we don't I don't think

in a normal mess and the math you guys

do I don't know you might learn just

great you don't do you work with mods

these do mod I think it was discrete we

did it we did it in the form of finding

lowest common denominators but we don't

go as far as RSA Oh in math three four

one one you learned full RSA a virgin ah

is it awesome yeah as far as his thomas

britz ah he's very good he says that's

the security course isn't it

information and ciphers yeah information

code yeah that's it do that course that

is a beautiful course and then don't

stop with that course keep going and the

whole field is so interesting

yeah but I don't know yeah I don't I

don't know I mean it's basically the

group properties of mods are and it's a

nice way of demonstrating things so you

might have come across it in that um but

yeah exactly what you've written here

who was it the wrote it because my

screens are the blocking and who is that

Oliver yeah what Oliver right everyone I

wish I'd written that everyone take a

screenshot of that Oliver except Oliver

actually we use different letters I

should tell you the standard letters

everyone uses just for sort of

communication so the plain text or the

message we often call em so I'd replace

the X with an M and the images we're

going to permute although this is this

going to be so confusing because that

that let's call the private and public

keys a and B so M to the a mod and we

always modify something called n because

n is like the size of yeah

and let's say it's equal say because C

can be a psychotic

and then let's do C to the B the

ciphertext to the be more Dan again this

is so good thank you

is this all over doing it again let's

have a look yeah you are you looked at

min and that equals the original message

back which is M okay it's unbelievable

but true I'll give you some actual

examples to do and you can convince

yourself it works it's very very

beautiful and maybe I'll teach you a bit

of the math behind it so you can work

out how to actually crack it because you

can cracks what it went one of them that

women are small enough you can actually

crack it

it's only when the numbers get big that

we don't have any efficient ways of

cracking it so maybe I'll teach you

enough that you can do that okay but

anyway let's go back to the screen and

so confusing what am I seeing here we go

all right so we've got 45 minutes let's

do it ah before we do the last 45

minutes at the end of this we're gonna

watch a movie

well going to watch a movie you don't

have to watch it but if you do want to

watch it I posted a thing today about a

link to it and you've got to sign up to

SPS but it's a free movie this isn't one

of my favorite movies it's such a well

and involved so many movies in my

favorite movies and this is such a

beautiful movie I can remember so well

the first time I saw it it actually oh

you're nodding Lisa have you seen this

movie yeah I would bet no one seeing

this movie it's such an old one and in

fact it was banned and censored for a

while because Winston Churchill thought

it was bad for the war effort because it

was made during the war um but it is the

most it's got Deborah Caron a fantastic

film and you normally just can't get up

a level money and SBS haven't in the

showing it's going to run out at some

time so it's a perfect time for us to

watch it every year I've wanted to watch

it so if you do want to watch at the end

of this lecture at 7 o'clock I'm gonna

leave sumon because last time we closed

them and it just caused all sorts of

nightmares and we couldn't talk to each

other and then I thought we can watch it

synchronized I'll shout out on the

microphone what did he said go and we

can all start watching and on SBS at the

same time and then there's ad breaks and

whenever is an ED break we can run back

to zoom and I can just check and we can

just talk and then back to the

so if anyone wants to watch it I do

recommend it it's a beautiful film if

you don't get to watch it with us now

and chat about it now with us then too

much of some other time when you're in

isolation

correct okay let's go down here

superfast what if we got alright so if

you want to do some projects there's all

sorts of interesting honors week you can

do or summer projects or special

projects I'm really interested in deep

proctoring actually that's now become

really interesting worldwide there's all

sorts of online proctoring stuff to

check people aren't cheating during

online exams and so on they also

hackable we're just down we've got to

hack them and we can publish it so

anyone that wants to do that is a

project working out how to hack online

exams and the standard methodologies

people used to run their online exams

let's do it with there's no problem with

getting funding to do that there's no

problem with getting that published and

it what you would be just doing the

world a favor because these horrible

intrusive things in everyone's life

weakening their security and not

actually providing real proctoring let's

expose that for what it is

adhi fingerprinting um so have a

defender printer phone because you're on

your device's fingerprint you so much so

working out suggested things that we can

do 2d fingerprint phones and then

arguing you know then publishing that

and having a standard on that and then

eventually Apple and various phone

manufacturers follow standards like that

we can suggest sensible ones the EMF

thing oh yeah we'll talk a bit more

about hear from in leakage leakage

before but that's really interesting the

droning is something I've been trying to

do for years and now actually companies

are making lots of money out of actual

tried harder but come up with ways of

taking denial with drones taking drones

down and again this hits if I think that

Iran wants to do that and and various

legal ways of doing in ways that

residential people could do it and then

ways that you can do it in military

context all of this stuff's really

interesting a little by RT stuff

anything to do with cameras and there's

all sorts of interesting forensics you

can do on cameras and faking stuff with

cameras and all sorts of things so

anyone that's interested in anything

like this oh and one other if you can

think of a fun project even just come to

us and we'll supervise it and support it

and get you all the gear you need

another really fun one who think that

just recently was

fooling facial-recognition so there's a

lot of research going into making fatal

facial recognition work how can we make

facial recognition not work what's the

minimum you've got to do to your face so

that surveillance doesn't detect who you

are I do little experiments with that

whenever I go through a passport I think

I've told you customs control I do it

when I get my photos taken for licenses

apparently eyebrows people pay a lot of

attention to eyebrows or shaving your

eyebrows off that's why Peter Dutton is

ahead of the game I think just doing

funny stuff changing your eyebrows

wearing silly glasses that have false

eyebrows on them is one way maybe but

then people will adapt to that it's

probably whack-a-mole but anyone that

wants to work on that problem of how

normal people can full facial

recognition that'll be a fun project or

any other fun projects you can think of

please speak to your tutor first if you

think it's awesome and then get in touch

with us my only lease or Lachlan and

we'll line you up with some fun work to

do in the news there's all sorts of

interesting stuff happening in the news

right now which country was up hungry

the president gave himself superpowers

and I pretty sure if I read the news

right there's no extent there's no time

limit on remember we're talking about

that the powers of a dictator important

in times of a crisis most important

thing to put in place you can give

people absolute power sure but it's

going to have a time limit on it

it's just 101 for governance he's giving

himself super powers but forgotten to

put a time limit on it so that's the end

of hungry they're already in a bad way

already before that lots of other

interesting things happening about

invasions of privacy I think we talked

about it on Monday given a crisis people

throw everything to the wind they just

focus on one thing so at the moment if

you say coronavirus you get anything

through so all sorts of legislations

going through I mentioned some

legislation that went through on

Wednesday and yourself as Parliament

that's actually been retracted since

that because we're a bit flawed but a

new version of that came out on Friday

she give you a link to that that's a

little bit frightening um so there's

just all this privacy stuff going

through super quick now and around the

world if you look at news media people

are saying let's just track all our

citizens let's just do this list is in

there and because it'll help us with

Perona and probably well so there you go

game over will do it no one's talking

about oversight no one's talking about

controls no one's talking about limits

no stuff about time and

and of course once the data is collected

so this is just a we're seeing a live

example now how people get pretty

focused on solving one problem that's

good for a long time known was focusing

on the virus and that was except the

poor people in China and so it's good at

least they're focusing but they've

switched from zero percent to a hundred

percent and really be welcome to be a

nice sensible Haven there's some fun

jewel heists going on well actually

their tragedies and people that do it at

Dick's but there's some interesting ones

that show interesting security

weaknesses and I think I might have

posted one on security everywhere

someone that just stole it with a

fishing line through a window because

they left something on display in the

shop and it was a gap between the top

and bottom of the doors there's some RSA

news from 2015 or so that was

interesting some stuff on misdirection

we did the two card monte find the lady

of the other three cat Monte within the

white phone because this is what I

booked I really like it's by a magician

where he talks about misdirection I

really like this I think I got

electronically and then I think I

actually got a real copy of the book too

though it's quite hard to get is that

done a trilogy of books that's really

interesting and if we get a chance I

will talk a bit more about misdirection

in the future

he's the kevin Mitnick picture if you've

ever seen him speak now he's a guy in a

suit it's very very wealthy but he is

him when he was a well was a teenager

when was he born 1963 we all know kevin

mitnick's date of birth well there you

go I was born in a different time in

California that's interesting and so

that's the arresting for kevin Mitnick

or the wanted poster of kevin Mitnick

wanted and then the hack of by knocking

never pronounce his names bed shimmer

and his genre and I still haven't talked

about that hack I keep promising and

we'll do it no we won't have time today

but we will do it before the end of the

course I promise

so lightning tore through the notes but

now there's some things I want to tell

you that sort of finishing off a few

bits and pieces we've already done with

symmetric ciphers that's the old sort of

let's just do something jumbly and

chaotic and do it a lot and hope people

can't undo it tight so first of all

there's two different sorts of ciphers

there's stream ciphers and block ciphers

and I'm really talked about that before

so a stream cipher you get letters one

at a time and you encrypt them one at a

time so you could imagine you could put

that on a telegraph line and as people

are transmitting

message letters OneNote on today today

today today in real time you could

create the bit to be put out the

ciphertext and if you saw there I did a

really funny message that's a stream

cipher block cipher is you accumulate

quite a lot of plaintext and then when

it's filled the bucket of whatever size

you want then you convert that whole

bucket into a hole in ciphered bucket so

typically did it that it did it in a bit

and then are sort of wish you know if

we're ever going to record part of a

lecture and play it back you can just

record that and play it back and say we

should sack this guy he's gone mad and

then just have me going out of context

it's very funny and again that was a

funny message in Morse code so we filled

the bucket up with paint X nothing's

gone out yet and now that we've got

enough plaintext we go and now we put

out the the psycho texture that we make

a ciphertext back and put that all that

so it fills up a bucket then sends it

now what's advantages indifferent

disadvantages of blocks and streams well

you can probably imagine that if you're

really just relying on jumbling things

up and making things confused then doing

it on a whole block at a time seems a

bit easier like you can transpose and

move things around inside the block

whereas if you do it on a stream then

you know that this character and the

plaintext corresponds to this character

and the ciphertext is just less stuff

going on so you've got to make sure what

you're doing to go from plaintext two

psychotics characters is very very

difficult to undo so block text block

ones tend to be they just seem to be

they oh no most of them are I don't know

I don't really know any good strange

ciphers I guess all the famous ciphers

are block ciphers we can talk about some

stream ciphers later on that have

weaknesses here's how a stream cipher

could work by the way a one-time pad

one-time pad is like a stream cipher so

if you had a genuine stream of random

numbers and then you got a stream of

plaintext and you just XOR them together

have we talked about exhorting before

does ever know about exhorting

everyone if you're not if you knew the

computer I know some people here are

look up X soaring just look up what it

means 2x or one number with another

number exerting is quite beautiful but

it just takes one number and takes a

pair of numbers and puts them together

to make another number

just like plus or x do so you can have a

table just like you have a x table you

could have an X all the table so the

nice thing about exhorting is if you do

it twice it undoes it so if I had a

strimmer stream of random numbers and a

stream of plaintext numbers and I just

exid the corresponding ones going across

that would give me a stream of

ciphertext and then if I X ordered again

with the same stream of random numbers

it'll give me the corresponding

plaintext back so yeah there's a comment

in the chat about letting some people

back into the video stream should wait

what let's take a boat it's not looking

good alright how do we do it does anyone

know I'm just i Richard I'm keeping an

eye on it so I can't see anyone there at

the moment I've been letting them in

you've been letting them in as they come

in

yeah all right thank you sorry not very

democratic I just made a decision to do

it that's good no that's good just let

him in let him in let him in let him in

with me

so welcome sorry if you got stuck in the

waiting room for a while I'm not all try

and fix it up so that doesn't happen

again next time must be on it'll be my

mistake I'll set it down setting

something so stream cyphers yeah that

would be a perfect cipher that would be

great if you could have a genuine stream

of random numbers and the problem is the

other person any other end also needs

the same stream of random numbers how

are you going to share two streams of

genuinely random numbers you can't the

whole randomness of it is that I can't

both generate them because they're

random you'd have to generate them in

advance and share them like a one-time

pad and then that doesn't really scale

does it and there's no clear way of

doing that from a key so how most people

do it a stream cipher or one way of

doing a stream cipher is this you have

something called a pseudo-random number

generator

so it's not really a random number

generator it's a pseudo-random user's

algorithmic methods but the numbers it

produced look random

work out if I ran them or not they look

red and then you have one that starts

with a key the key sets are going and

different keys give different sequences

of random numbers but different keys

give that the same keys give the same

sequence of random numbers so we agree

on a key in advance and lots of whips a

lot of the stuff on Wi-Fi it uses this

so we agree on a key in advance that

receiver and the transmitter and then we

sposta our trends computing our streams

of pseudo-random numbers and iyx or the

message going out with them and you Rick

saw the message coming back in with them

ensign that's all done but block ciphers

are the most common ones so a DES RSA

all that sort of stuff

block cycle so I'm just talking about

block ciphers if you think about it

suppose you've got a block size of I

don't know 500 bits

say then you've got to break your

message into 500 bit chunks and then you

in cipher reach 500 bit chunk of

plaintext to get 500 big chunk of

ciphertext and then you join all those

I've had a bit song some choice

architects together to get your whole

psycho text in and then the other end

you break the chunks of ciphertext into

buckets of 512 bits big and then you

decrypt each bucket and then you put all

those together and that gives you the

plenty so it's basically a matter of

bucketing and unn bucketing so there's

two challenges here

one is alright I've got a ciphertext

method of working on a bucket but how do

i how do I encrypt a whole message it's

got multiple buckets so I just join all

those bits together or should I do

something more complicated and that the

that is called the mode of the cipher so

what mode should I use on the cypher

what block mode X is called the block

manners are what block mode should I use

the naive one I've just encrypt every

block separately and concatenate them

together stick them all together

that's code electronic codebook mode ECB

mode um but it turns out that's quite

weak for a range of reasons so you

should probably look up actually that's

it but what's the problem with ECB mode

so people do more elaborate modes and

I'll show you the modes in a second but

the other problem that we get with

blocks is that it's very your message is

exactly 512 or however long it is packet

size it's long so there's an often a

little bit left at the end what do you

do

what we normally do is we pad that out

to make it the right length paddled out

with rubbish or something to make it the

right length so it fits in a bucket and

then at the other end when they decode

the whole thing they work out that

that's padding and they throw it away so

how do we Pat it out and how do they

work out that it's panning turns out

that's really delicate and if you get

that wrong you can crack the whole

message and the there's the famous way

of doing that is called a padding Oracle

attack and I'd love you to read about

padding Oracle attacks and see if you

can work out how they work I asked so

beautiful so that's just an example of

you think you've got a good

cryptographic method but the way you

implement it isn't right and remember

what I told you about implementing

cryptographic methods what if we said

don't do it don't ever do it just don't

do it if anyone ever walks up to you and

says ah we're gonna use RSA I'll write

my own version of it just you should

keep a big kippur in a box and just hit

them over the head with the key person

to ask

it's a bug bounty program that's what I

think but first I have a bridge to sell

you

and yeah so yeah absolutely just don't

do it that's right Oh a bug bounty

program so you can profit from it I

really Mickey you have a devious mind I

think you have a security mind you I'm

saying don't do things and you're saying

no no let's not say not do things let's

work out where the advantage is if they

do the people are going to be people if

you attack them at every step they'll

never listen to you yeah that's right

that's right so help them out that help

yourself at the same time you know it

started sounding like candy and an ended

sounding like Machiavelli it was a very

nice transition over that piece of

advice and so here in the different

modes electronic codebook Mon you can

see here if you look at the picture I

hope you can see it can you see it

Oliver can you see they say yeah yeah

you can't thank you um so you can see

each block of plaintext gets in ciphered

and then they will get stuck together at

the end and the same key is used for the

buckets that's ECB mode annotate and

then below how you do it

cipher block chaining that's that's a

very interesting mode on this one here

you you start with something called an

initialization vector and that's public

everyone knows it or we always call them

IVs it's the thing that starts the ball

rolling so there's an IV and you XOR the

plaintext with it so you jumble up the

plaintext before you start then you do

what you do normally you encrypt that

whole bucket and you get the ciphertext

and then as well as putting that

ciphertext in the output you take a copy

of it and you use that as the

initialization vector for the next block

you XOR that with the plaintext and bla

bla bla ba ba ba ba that means a change

to any one block has to ripple through

the whole message so if you get one

little bit wrong the whole message is

different so you can't crack it block by

block the whole mess is sort of ties

together in dependencies by increasing

coupling amusingly you make it harder

for the attacker because it's more

brittle and here's how you decrypt you

should look at that and make sure it

makes sense but it's actually quite

simple

my favorite mode is this one though it's

called counter mode and using counter

mode you don't actually encrypt the

message you encrypt counters so you

start with the counter

that's a counters a series of numbers

that you only ever use once and a number

that you only ever used once we do that

in cryptography software we give them a

special name does anyone know what

that's called nonce

normos it stands for number once so a

number you only use once is a nonce and

the easiest nonce to use is just start

with 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 so let's say that's

what we do but it doesn't really matter

how you do it here so you've got the

counter and you encrypt the counter

using the key then you get that answer

and you XOR it with the plaintext and

that gives you the psychotics and then

you get the second number in the counter

and you encrypt that with you encrypt

that with the key and then you XOR that

with the plaintext and that gives you

the ciphertext and so on and so on the

time can everyone say it looks weird

you're not encrypting the text you're

encrypting ok you're encrypting the

counter you clear always generating I

was hoping song would notice that it's a

one-time pad for blocks and the rent

sequence of random numbers you getting

generated by encrypting a sequence of

counting numbers because if your

encryption really does a good encryption

algorithm if you change the input even

slightly the output should be randomly

different so it's actually awesome it is

truly awesome it is so clever and the

other really nice thing about this is

why it's my favorite mode I don't know

people don't use it I think sometimes

but it's a bit counterintuitive maybe

people are suspicious so Christian

mentioned this along with RSA a few

weeks ago and I started looking to them

and what I really like about counter

mode is one you can encrypt or decrypt

in parallel because of the counters and

two it's meant to be more secure than

RSA you can encrypt more bits than RSA

without weakening the cipher so cycle

blockchain you can you can leverage yeah

you can leverage it in that you it lets

you leverage what you're doing so the

expensive thing which is running RSA you

only would have to do oh I didn't

understand maybe it's they having a

comment offline so I can work out

exactly what you mean

but yeah normally you would try and do

this too so what I meant was there's a

limit to how much information you can

encrypt with a given key before there's

enough entropy out there to reverse the

key and counter mode has a higher

entropy than cipher block changing oh

yeah absolutely absolutely absolutely

that's right but the first point you

raise the one that always blows me away

which is the other modes so for example

if we look at cipher block chaining you

can't notice you can't do the second one

oh you can do the second one oh no sorry

the encryption you can't do the second

one until after you've done the first

one and you see that because if I use my

mouse the plaintext is here you have to

encrypt it mm-hmm and then I've given

cryptic you use that as initialization

for the next one and after you encrypt

that you set as initialization vector

for the next one so on so this is

dependency between all the blocks and

you have to do one then the next then

the next and the next

but down here there's no dependency

between the blocks so you can do my

parallel

very nice and if it blocks arrived out

of order it's not a problem if you lose

a block that's not a problem

very very nice um okay padding Oracle's

homework is to find them and how we're

going for time look at all that time

we've got we've got so much time have I

been speaking really quickly I bet I

have um so I'm just gonna take a

breather for one second and ask you guys

if you want to say something or ask

something and then I'll show you the end

of the list so anyone that wants to say

or ask anything

thanks for and who sent the photos by

the way that's fantastic it's so good if

I wasn't completely stressed out by

losing the recording and have to record

it again out of stripped off the

metadata and post it already anyone that

hasn't sent a photo if you just send me

a photo of you just smiling or deforming

your face like some people have done it

really really choose me up and when I

eventually get the metadata stripped out

all posting for everyone to see and so

yeah please just grab your phone take a

random photo of you're doing something

random in isolation and I promised I'd

do it did not I haven't telling you I

will do that too so any questions all

and no one has any question about

anything I can't believe no one has any

question I have a question about the

privacy that we were talking about last

lecture um I don't know I guess it's a

personal preference but it can kind of

seem like you go to the whole point

where you up tone your life you make

everything so difficult for you to

achieve like how do you find that how do

you find a nice balance what balance

should you aim for yeah yeah I mean

that's the million-dollar question we

leave that question you've asked could

be applied to anything in security and

that's when you graduate I hope what

you're always going to do this this

you're 100% there's no way of living

your life it's crazy because you don't

have infinite resources so if you go 100

on some things you're forcing yourself

to go zero on others it's the type 1

type 2 sort of trade-off but in a

different context um the shape of that

trade-off but yeah um so yeah Laurens

spot-on and the real question as a

security person is we can never get

perfection so how do we spend our

resources to get optimum perfection and

it depends on what things are worth to

you like what your particular profile is

what some things might be more important

to you than to other people and other

things less and so on but the the sort

of thing that economics tells us is you

should put as much effort into

everything so everything gives you an

equal return essentially so if there's

something that's a massive problem put

as much effort into it until you've

reduced it the concern it's holding down

to this level but if you now you've

lowered this lower than some other thing

you're concerned about and put effort

into that thing to bring it down and

just do it simultaneously on all the

things

just take one all the way down that's

stupid because again weakest link life

will kick you with the thing you didn't

pull down so for privacy my thought is

it's very hard for individuals to

maintain privacy I just do it as a sort

of final intellectual exercise to see

how it's possible but the whole world's

conspiring against me so 23andme some

people send in their DNA to be tested

just like the FBI fingerprinting and of

course their company keeps the data and

sells it on and links it to other data

into how two brokers sell it and now

it's tied to your name and data verse

and address and things so you can try

you can just say well I'm not going to

use 23andme

good advice um but if your family does

it you're caught you can not use

Facebook I don't use Facebook but if

people put me in photos and tag me and

presently I don't know how I do can you

only take people with people in facebook

maybe if I don't have a Facebook account

at all I'm sorry you won't get to your

profile but they can still put your name

in it yeah which will come up in many

Google searches yeah yeah

you've got crazy relatives of fill in

ancestry trees you got you know people

just leaked your data for you so you

cannot reach perfection you've just got

to work out the best you can do I mean

quote me on it but I think Facebook

keeps shadow profiles as well which

means you've actually got a Facebook

profile whether you've signed up or not

and then yeah when when you do sign up

inevitably they'll dull attach all the

data that they've kept in shadow to that

profile thank you

I downloaded my facebook profile for the

activity and I noticed that they there

was evidence for people having shadow

profiles from my phone contacts which is

Jesus Christ in other words people that

aren't on Facebook were still what can

you did you post that can I find see

what you did that sounds really

interesting um I just made a quick

comment on it on one of the homework

activities I can download my facebook

data again but they had like a list of

people I know and some of them were

people who didn't have Facebook accounts

who I just had in my phone from like

five years ago as contacts who

now our in facebook and presumably have

a shadow profile if they know their name

and could attach whatever else to it

yeah yeah yeah so um so going back to

Lauren's question so we can't kill

ourselves you've just got to survive and

you know do the best we can I hope

because you guys are smart and you're

the next generation and you're going to

go out there and you're going to be

professionals and some of you will be

seeing you and I know that because it's

happened with students I've been

teaching them they're out now really

you're always making decisions so the

way to affect this at a personal level

is not much we can do but as you become

influential and go out there you can be

a sensible voice there needs to be a

sensible voice in the conversation I

hope some of you become politicians

because politicians really didn't

understand this at all I hope some of

you become CEOs of companies and put

make the companies do the right things

you know I just think the way this needs

I said before the thing with privacy is

there are these different actors can't

believe I said it what's a better word

entities entities yeah thanks there's

different entities so the government

really wants to get your data and do

things with it for good purposes and the

business really wants to get your data

and do good things with it for good

purpose this making and individuals

don't mind giving up their data so that

as an individual as an individual as an

individual you don't have a lot of power

and that whole thing but maybe as we go

out so I think we need to attack this

problem at the level of governments and

their corporations so yeah I think we

need to educate to bring about change so

so you just have to pick your battles

and work out the right ones but I think

being informed you've just got to be

informed you can't be a democracy not

being formed citizen and then you guys

are cleverer than me maybe you'll think

of ways of doing it but yeah you can get

worried about it so much and do nothing

and then that's hopeless you know I mean

at least we're not alive 200 years ago

when we could just get polio or smallpox

or or even more years ago where the lord

of the manor could because come and take

us and kill us or make us a slave you

know you know there's lots of bad things

in life you know in the scheme of things

this isn't as bad as that but life could

be better if that we weren't in a

surveillance state because it is leading

in a scary direction so we should try

make it better but I don't think we

should get depressed Lauren you suddenly

look a bit darker is every we seen your

emotional state in the environment

around you uh yeah that's definitely it

it's not a sunset at all okay yeah so

there were great questions is it one one

more I'm sure that time for one more

before I show you the next thing I'm

just moving the laptop lid down so I can

see you all someone asked a question in

chat about whether or not we discussed

the final exam if we know what's

happening with that I don't know if we

have do you want me to discuss it again

if we have all for the first time if we

haven't no peg home for our exam that's

because we're riding it to be a

three-hour exam four hours so you've got

more time and you can be more relaxed

and if you've got technical problems you

don't get all stress I need to get

finished in three and yeah well we'll

send you the exam we're likely going to

trust you we might do one or two really

banal security measures that I'll tell

you about just about a week in advance

well you know Toby book okay yeah but is

that just with access to the shed you

know it so we've been taking or is that

everything everywhere no no I think it

has to be access to everything

everywhere because because it runs only

human if I said to you do this exam but

promised to me you won't go on the

Internet it's a hard thing to ask anyone

and if you did it you'd feel

disappointed in yourself but you know

you might do it it's hard what if it's

really important to pass this course

what if it affects your visa or

something you know and I'm sort of

putting in the world moral hazard

encouraging you to do something bad I

think it's unconscionable to do that and

then if you didn't do it then you might

be all the time jealous and thinking is

not fair cheating cheating so I think

just I don't want to put you in that way

and the other thing is I could lock down

your computer and do all sorts of

paternalistic controls on it and

I don't think that's a writer like

there's some of those proctoring

services people have been telling

everyone about on Facebook that I'm very

much not a fan of no that's right that's

right

I think it's the wrong relationship for

a teacher to have with their students

essentially it's one of distrust it's be

like me saying to my children I don't

know we don't like the alcohol up

maybe you shouldn't but we don't because

so regarding the benign proctoring

you're considering what's that for

oh just something to just make it

slightly harder to do some sort of

cheating okay just to remove some

temptation from you cheating Cisco I

just I'm really just for your interest

I'm just trying to settle up so at the

end of it one feels yeah that was

probably okay yeah so yeah that's how I

do it and just you know you know how I

think about marks anyway in this course

I just want you to come out of this

course being better and I hope the

course has helped you and you've learnt

some stuff and you've changed because

who cares about marks you know who talks

about the HSC anymore it's so ridiculous

when you leave uni no one's going to

care about these silly marks we talk

about all the time now what matters is

how awesome you are when you go for your

first job interview no one's gonna say I

want me and marks they're gonna say tell

us about you what something awesome

you've done what can you do and if

you've done all some things and can do

all something says your portfolio will

show then they'll hire you and if you

change it and got high marks

maybe they'll hire you for a little bit

you know you'll be found out almost

right away so you know I just think you

need here to help you become awesome and

it'd be like trying to stop people

cheating at the gym someone riding on

their gym workout sheet I push ten

kilograms up but really they only push

day so we could have some sort of

surveillance cameras around to check

that when you write down how many

kilograms you pushed up it was a real

number that you actually pushed up but

who cares because the only person that

looks at that little shape is you to

track the progress and make yourself

awesome are so awesome are is actually a

word

hope you won so that's how we're gonna

do the exam so I'm hoping the exam will

be fun if I've done it right you come

out of the exam going well who that was

really interesting

Wow I'm really proud look at all this

stuff on you I thought we just talked

all the time didn't learn anything and

now I can do all this stuff but I

couldn't have done at the beginning of

the course now I want to tell you a

little puzzle we've got 13 minutes left

if you've got more things you want to

chat about then hang out and watch a

movie and chat at the end or during the

ads or just message me or some of your

I'm very happy to talk to anyone at any

time or respond to emails or or open

learning I try and go through checking

all the comments on up and learning so

yeah right new messages there and if you

want me to email me write a message

there saying what your email address is

Monday um

oh yeah Andrew I just on another quick

question about the exam how did you

raise your hand that was so impressive

oh there's like there's a button that

says write his hand and then I think it

gets your attention it did that was

fantastic

oh yeah so just another question about

the exam would be live online or is it

one where we get given an assessment

paper we write our answers in some

document and submit it by the time I see

what you're asking it should be over um

so two parts to them one is obviously

the second one for me is much better

than the first one because I can just

think of all the things that could go

wrong with the second one you know your

internet goes down or some stupid coding

error we've made awesome you know I just

sort of at a time of stress I want

everything to work so as much as

possible it's gonna be the first one

that I give you something you can be

offline or online or whatever and you

can just work on it write it in a word

processor every choice or whatever but

at the end probably just submit a PDF or

a text file probably actually just a

text file second but part two there are

a couple of practical things to be doing

six April 1 now we're going to try to do

much of the prank we normally have a

very practical exam and we're not going

to be how it could have been more

practical she because we're teaching

more practical stuff finally but it's

going to hold us up so Rocklin is

fooling around with a couple of

different versions but there might be

you have to go online and attack

beside all this something like that

there might be some for that practical

component where you have to be online if

you're doing 684 yeah but I guess if

it's something like getting a flag then

still the answers could be done in a

separate document and submitted like

this oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no

you'll just submit some document but you

might need to be online to go and do

something yeah this is whether they give

you the binary or they just hosted

somewhere yeah yeah that's right

this is all the stuff that we're falling

around with there's obviously a banner

just as disa been just about we want it

to be bulletproof simple and keep you

guys happy that's all right um yeah so

anyone else that if anyone has urgent

are no exams sometimes a stressful so

raise your hand if you have another

question about it there was a question

before about the job application thing

and confirming that that will be

published like the expectations or the

criteria for they'll be published

shortly Thank You Oliver

and that's Lachlan there's probably

grinning like an idiot as we're talking

now because for about I wrote something

three weeks ago and I keep saying ah

command a post that today and then every

day some stupid thing comes up and I

don't post it so bad marks to me for

time management I think that's probably

more important than getting Monday's

lecture up what do you reckon maybe I'll

do that first thing tomorrow and then

I'll record the replacement lecture

second how does that sound

yes yeah sounds great

um oh and the last thing about the

replacement let young do you want me to

actually just run another lecture and

the ones that missed it can turn in and

this time I'll make recording work so

even if you don't watch it you could

still see a recording because if you did

I thought we could do it at 9:00

tomorrow I have a little gap between

9:00 and 10:00 I do a super-fast lecture

what do people think of that

would people be interested in zooming in

at 9:00 o'clock would anyone want to do

that that hasn't caught the lecture

which lecture is this for we went on

Monday you were there Lauren but the

recording didn't work so people that

weren't there didn't get to say in yeah

9:00 a.m. tomorrow

yeah and that's depressing but I've got

a camp thing good idea I think would you

would you come Jones if I did it then oh

you're very Thanks same with me okay all

right I will I will do that let's do

something at 9:00 tomorrow morning and

then then we'll get a recording oh my

just but anyone else is very welcome to

come more people the better oh look at

the time we've only got eight minutes

but I think we can do it so and sorry

would you have the recording of this new

one like you died morose no tomorrow 9

a.m. 1 yeah yeah that's the idea

I won't be able to really be recording

that yeah yeah yeah that's ok

yes you know that's absolutely right um

the whole reason I'm doing is to get a

recording but I just think it's more fun

to do it we're actually talking to each

other I yeah because I won't be able to

attend that I have to attend it I'm

doing it to produce a recording yeah

cool thank you and if that doesn't

record then or if tonight's literally I

don't even know what I'm gonna do I'm

just gonna cry yeah yeah you definitely

all record everything yeah yeah never

trust me things go wrong all-time record

record record that's a great on you

okay now we've got a little bit of time

I'm just going to do what's on the

spring now so we've got this puzzle see

be easy essential eight oh one more okay

let's do CVS Oh actually can I just make

that something for you to find out about

well cap cvs cvs are a standard way of

numbering vulnerabilities that people

find so you know there's bugs

vulnerabilities the next one bugs and

mistakes in software vulnerabilities are

bugs that potentially weaken the

security of the system and an exploit is

something that makes use of that

vulnerability to weaken the system so

when a security researcher is looking

through code they're hunting for all the

bugs and trying to see if any of them

have vulnerabilities and if they find

them they report them and they get given

a number and that is Fame so if you ever

get an it they give you the numbers are

called CVS so if you ever get a CVA I

think we give people automatic extra

marks is Lachlan in you he Oh Chris yeah

we give people extra marks if they get a

CV you don't think yeah I'm not sure if

we put that in the outline this year but

we do yeah I do we bring that online

that if you do something also we get in

the whole foam you get an extra mark or

two I'm not sure the extra marks but

what counts anything that blows us away

and the CVE blows us away so you'd get

literally yeah you get an extra two

marks or something if you find a CV but

the main thing is you'd go on our list

of people that have found CVS famous

people shame there's no marks can be

marks it's still marked in my head I'm

still gonna say who came first I'm still

gonna you know oh if you go on to do six

four four seven will still look at them

actually get in this course to work out

eligibility four six four four seven and

I'll still write you a letter if you

have a need one I'm saying bloody hell

Oliver God ninety nine in this course so

you can't see it because of the stupid

virus on the transcript and you know I

thoroughly support anyone hiring him

he's amazing you know so I'll still use

that number whenever I can to help you

the recommendation from you is probably

worth more than

yeah I think recommendations from to

confirm and when we look at

recommendations we always look at how

you weigh in so we speak to you tutor

and marks are one of the things we look

at not the only thing of course because

you could be awesome and get low marks

because you got distracted by something

or had a bad run or whatever but you

know it's a part of the evidence reason

so yeah it is a pity there's no marks

but none maybe I'm trying to be positive

and think maybe it'll be good maybe

we'll learn some stuff from this you

know you can you can just get upset

about that like Lauren was saying before

you just got to pick the battles you got

to pick what you get upset about there's

some things that are too big and you

can't change and probably won't make

much difference and then there's other

things where your efforts make a big

difference in there it's just you know

it's part of being wise and it's working

out which is which and it's so hard to

do when it's in your face and it's

affecting your emotions but yeah anyway

I don't think it's something I'm gonna

work I just think in the scheme of

things there's nothing in the world um

alright essentially so sometimes people

write lists of mistakes that other

people make because we see and this is a

lesson from history people just always

make the same mistakes over and over

again and I guess if you're a

penetration tester or an auditor must be

so annoying to see firm after firm after

firm making the same mistakes so various

organizations are made list of saying

hey guys here's ten things you should

fix up at least to be a bit more secure

well here's a list of the most common

vulnerabilities we found types of honor

abilities we found this year compared it

with last year's list it's the same

ordering um so people put them all

together so look up the essential eight

that's a bare minimum of what

organizations should do it's the top

eight of a list it's much much longer

look at all wasp just look at these

things they're just lists of obvious

things that people should do and they'll

be worth knowing and look up some CVS

because they're so interesting go to the

CV database click on a few and find out

what the vulnerabilities worth is so

much fun okay but now we've only got

three minutes and the best bid I had so

much time and I was blown at all but I

reckon we can do it in three minutes by

speaking it's the Stargate ghost problem

this is a problem that occurred to me

about the same time I was first teaching

this course so of

try and put it in the course because it

I'm very fond of it and and the problem

is this it's a TV show called Star Game

I don't know if you've ever seen it it's

a science fiction show I never really

watched it so I don't know much about it

i there's a guy in it who's very

confident and he speaks in an American

accent and it's just my bias I know but

if someone's really confident and speaks

in American accent I find them a little

bit of brazing so I call him the

abrasive man but actually I suspect he's

the hero of the show he's not really

abrasive and I've seen lots of episodes

I'd really love it

everything's so so don't take this

personally if you are abrasive men or a

later team but let's just call him

abrasive man so there's abrasive man and

abrasive man goes through this thing on

the library lawn you know that big

circle we've got on the library lawn

well if you go through that you go to

another dimension and he went through

that and went to another dimension and

every episode they'd go through that and

go to another dimension and then come

back through it into earth and the

military owned this swing thing in this

universe in this TV showed the military

run you want to stubble you and they

would send people through the ring thing

and it's called the Stargate

so in this particular episode he goes

through the Stargate it goes to another

universe he meets creatures in this

other universe I can t really remember

the details in this episode and I knew

remember library telling select he comes

back to our universe and the person

that's travelling and a person travels

back from the other universe with him

but the weird thing is no one can see

him anymore but everyone can see the

person that came back with him so he

comes back through the Stargate and he's

talking to everyone I was going where is

he going where is he where's he gone why

have you come back and the alien says

yes I've traveled from the other thing

with the abrasive man and the abrasive

man is here but he's been shifted

through 90 degrees of the fourth

dimension and you can't see him anymore

but I can and the crazy man saying tell

him I'm here tell him I'm here in the

crazy man and the alien says he's here

he's here now this is a military base

and they're trying to work out if this

planets good or bad or if I should blow

it up or so there's some various

decisions to be made and there's a major

that runs a military base that wants to

ask this guy abrasive man what happened

on this planet if it's dangerous if we

need to worry about if we need to blow

it up whatever

but he can't talk to him he can only

talk to the alien and that alien has to

relay messages from the major to the

invisible man actually I think the

Invisible Man can hear that alien it can

hear the major but the major can't hear

the Invisible Man so it's only one more

thing so that made you can talk to the

abrasive man but abrasive man has to

talk a lien and hey lien has to talk to

the major and of course the alien has a

vested interest here he doesn't really

want his world to be blown up and he

could be sinister maybe he rotated him

through nine degrees through the fourth

dimensions puddle plot so anyway here's

the challenge I was just wondering about

it later I can't even remember what the

episode was about but this thing started

biting and I started thinking if I was a

crazy if I was the abrasive man or if I

was a general what kind of cars would I

use me how would I be able to talk about

the things we needed to talk about when

literally I have an untrusted medium how

can I do that and so that I call the

Stargate ghost problem is a bit like a

ghost so I'd like you to think about the

Stargate ghost problem

see if you can think of ways of solving

it and I've been thinking about it for

years and every now and then I think of

new ways and new ideas which have

strengths and weaknesses and I'm sure

you'll come up with other ones that are

better than mine and sometimes I find

weaknesses to ways that I previously

thought were good so just think about

the Stargate ghost problem does that

make sense to everyone yes it's an

interesting problem okay I've gone one

minute over I think that's not too bad

what are you working thank you for your

patience while I went and did that

ABC thing um thank you Chris for

announcing your lecture on Friday is

that right people curse days so first

day at 6 p.m. so if you want to do some

wireless hacking then that's where you

gotta go Thursday 6 p.m. go to Chris's -

it's on the table and we'll make an

announcement on open learning on

Thursday morning - saying where it is

but driving the truth table shouldn't it

yes and we'll post a video of that later

so everyone doing 6 8 4 1 even if you

can't turn up to Chris's class and watch

it gotta watch the lecture that's these

and Lachlan how we go we had an

extension lecture from a few weeks ago

that we were going to record did we ever

do that if I just not notice owner is

that still in progress I'm not sure what

you're talking about sorry

the week 5 extension lecture I don't

think there was no extension lecture for

week 5 Oh perfect

[Music]

ok so I hope some of you gonna stay

around watch the movie to everyone

that's not goodbye it's lovely seeing

you all again and hearing your crickets

and all that sort of stuff and

aeroplanes and the dogs barking and I

wish you all the best I hope you have

lots of fun in the course if I can help

you with anything message me keep

sharing those bonds because I'm enjoying

them keep sharing your tips because

they're inspiring send me photos if you

can because it makes me very happy every

time I get one and I'll see you on

Monday unless I see you at 9 a.m.

tomorrow if you're coming to the ketchup

lecture and for those that are hanging

around for the lecture for the movie the

best movie ever make sure you log in to

SPS now create an account only takes a

few seconds and search for blimp and

you'll find the movie and just get it

stopped at zero zero zero zero and in

about five minutes I'll shout out go and

we can all go so I'm gonna go around and

get my one setup on the other machine

keep listening to this if you can maybe

even you could zoom in on your mobile

phone if you wanted to watch it on your

laptop and to everyone else good bye see

you bye Richard

thank you everyone see Richard

hey guys I've got my one setup I'll give

you a few more minutes to do yours

it's SPS kaamdar you

you know Google SBS on-demand probably

it's a little it's buried inside the SBS

line

SBS on-demand completely free whoa Thank

You SBS and will stab or start at 7:10

so if you need to go and get some food

or something go and do that I'm not

gonna kick some popcorn or something and

we'll come back in at 7:10 or press the

Go button
